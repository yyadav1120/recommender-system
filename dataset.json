                        "plaidHtml": "Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as &quot;The Movie&quot;.  When I say &quot;The Movie&quot;, my friends know exactly what I&#39;m talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don&#39;t refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it&#39;s name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those &quot;Budget Theaters&quot; over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said &quot;That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!&quot; There&#39;s really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... &quot;HOPE&quot;.  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just &quot;comes together&quot; is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a &quot;must buy&quot; for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I&#39;ve seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, &quot;That was a great movie, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as good as &#39;you know what&#39;!&quot;  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my &quot;favorite of all time&quot;, but they&#39;ve all fallen far short of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You&#39;re guaranteed to find it in the &quot;employee picks&quot; section. And if it isn&#39;t in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven&#39;t bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!",

                        "plaidHtml": "Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.<br/><br/>Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I&#39;ve seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn&#39;t done either.<br/><br/>The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman&#39;s love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.<br/><br/>This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner&#39;s Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn&#39;t been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)<br/><br/>The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you&#39;d notice . . .",

What really pulled me in right from the start is what we&#39;ve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it&#39;s a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it&#39;s just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there&#39;s the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39;. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of &quot;chapters&quot; – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it&#39;s just a pure joy to watch.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even &quot;stealing&quot; from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino&#39;s masterpiece today, it&#39;s impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39;. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it&#39;s got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it&#39;s such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It&#39;s – well: it&#39;s &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39;. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

                        "plaidHtml": "Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.<br/><br/>This picture was Leone&#39;s most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title &quot;the ugly&quot;  this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title &quot;the bad&quot;, telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie&#39;s first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It&#39;s not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title &quot;the good&quot;  obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.<br/><br/>Leone&#39;s trademark long drawn out face-offs  exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa&#39;s samurai films  are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.<br/><br/>We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.<br/><br/>Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith  given the treacherous and chequered nature of the &quot;good&quot;  but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it&#39;s sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme  Leone wasn&#39;t trying to make some grand statement here  it&#39;s simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.<br/><br/>This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don&#39;t see that the war is going on. The central characters aren&#39;t concerned with the it  they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I&#39;ve nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art  he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting  Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It&#39;s funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef&#39;s early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said &quot;bad guy&quot; his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.<br/><br/>Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it&#39;s great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital  it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the &quot;bad&quot; when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today&#39;s technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.",

I, however, couldn&#39;t wait to read the book after seeing this film. I&#39;ve read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than I can remember.<br/><br/> Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I&#39;m now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.<br/><br/> This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.<br/><br/> David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on &#39;Seven&#39; and &#39;The Game&#39; had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.<br/><br/> Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can&#39;t help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there&#39;s the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don&#39;t believe me? Read &#39;Survivor&#39; and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You&#39;ll cry, you&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll do all the clichés but most importantly you&#39;ll identify with every single thing on the screen.<br/><br/> This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven&#39;t seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the nearest videostore!<br/><br/> 5/5",

The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who&#39;s leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn&#39;t feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm&#39;s Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.<br/><br/>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word &quot;epic&quot; and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what&#39;s going on.<br/><br/>10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "I&#39;m nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn&#39;t follow up to &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can&#39;t help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.<br/><br/>Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film &quot;Paprika&quot; in the whole &quot;invading dreams&quot; plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.<br/><br/>Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it&#39;s either all-visuals-no-smarts (&quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;) or the exact opposite (&quot;Doubt&quot;, &quot;Invictus&quot;). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.<br/><br/>Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan&#39;s perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can&#39;t explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It&#39;s like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film&#39;s humanity, and this is where &quot;Inception&quot; shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That&#39;s right, years.<br/><br/>Once the film ends, you&#39;ll want to watch it again, for there&#39;s something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film&#39;s ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (&quot;Avatar&quot; be damned).<br/><br/>Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort &quot;Shutter Island&quot;. He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can&#39;t seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.<br/><br/>Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (&quot;The Dark Knight&quot;). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie&#39;s quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer&#39;s complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that&#39;s really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And &quot;Inception&quot; can proudly stand alongside &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.<br/><br/>There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.<br/><br/>Missing this film and not getting the film&#39;s point is a crime.<br/><br/>Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",

It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn&#39;t mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",

But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you&#39;ll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.<br/><br/>The plot is one of the best movie plots I&#39;ve seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",

I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  &quot;Se7en&quot; is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It&#39;s  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché&#39;s. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene&#39;s, this seriously ain&#39;t no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren&#39;t just only the gross scene&#39;s that are good, there are also some  scene&#39;s that are made with lot&#39;s of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10",

There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of &quot;It&#39;s A Wonderful Life&quot; still hold true today. Yes, I&#39;ll say it, it&#39;s a wonderful movie.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Story-telling at its finest, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is a terrific film not because of a handful of memorable scenes or lines, but rather because scene-by-scene, frame-by-frame, it tells an interesting story as well as it is possible to tell it.  The story and characters are developed carefully, and everything about the movie, from the settings and props to the musical score, is done carefully and expertly.<br/><br/>Mifune grabs the attention in most of his scenes, and Shimura&#39;s more restrained character is a nice balance.  Those two have the best parts, but all seven of the samurai are memorable characters.  The sequence of events that collects the seven together occupies the first part of the movie, and forms a perfect foundation for the rest.  A few of the villagers are also portrayed nicely, although they are naturally overshadowed when the samurai are around.<br/><br/>The story always moves along nicely, with many ups and downs.  It has enough unpredictability to keep you interested the whole time, without ever losing its credibility.  There is plenty of action, but there is also substance behind the action to give it more significance.  The only possible drawback is the long running time (you can always split it up into two installments, but it&#39;s more satisfying if you can watch the whole story through at once), but there is little that you could cut out, even if you wanted to.  It holds your attention the entire time with a good story and great technique, not by resorting to sensational or sordid details.<br/><br/>This movie well deserves its reputation for excellence, and is one that everyone who appreciates classic cinema will want to see and enjoy.",

The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs.

I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn&#39;t get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.",

It provided me with something that everyone in one or another shape or form needs -- Hope.  The movie showed the cruelty of life and yet managed to shed some light and insight into the beauty of love and life in general.<br/><br/>I urge anyone who has not seen La Vita è bella to go out there and watch it. If we all take with us just little bit of that hope and love that this movie is trying to convey; this world would be a much better place.<br/><br/>\nThank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as I did.",

I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn&#39;t see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn&#39;t compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn&#39;t a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look.",

The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.<br/><br/>Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire&#39;s space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.<br/><br/>The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.<br/><br/>If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it&#39;s an absolute must see.<br/><br/>More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",

What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It&#39;s something to think about.<br/><br/>I won&#39;t reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven&#39;t seen it. Let&#39;s just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.<br/><br/>The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.<br/><br/>Anyone who watches this movie will love it.",

                        "plaidHtml": "There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering unto the public works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.<br/><br/>Much like Miyazaki&#39;s previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fairytale fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.<br/><br/>The world of Spirited Away is simply bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki&#39;s character designs, much like in Mononoke, is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll&#39;s Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, even fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.<br/><br/>The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline, to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams.<br/><br/>Prepare to be Spirited Away........................",

                        "plaidHtml": "The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland&#39;s most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.<br/><br/>Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler&#39;s List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler&#39;s List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler&#39;s List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist&#39;s Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.<br/><br/>Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, &quot;What will happen to us?&quot; and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.<br/><br/>A mention must be made of Brody&#39;s performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee&#39;s &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; and Terrence Malick&#39;s &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.<br/><br/>Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn&#39;t until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn&#39;t as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren&#39;t words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.<br/><br/>The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn&#39;t even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.<br/><br/>--Shelly",

                        "plaidHtml": "Ridley Scott&#39;s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I&#39;m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.<br/><br/>In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann&#39;s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator&#39;s success is there for all to see.<br/><br/>What we do in life echoes in eternity.<br/><br/>So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly &quot;Grade A&quot; stuff, and there&#39;s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe&#39;s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life&#39;s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.<br/><br/>Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen&#39;s turn here against that of Diane Kruger&#39;s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that&#39;s inspiring.<br/><br/>I didn&#39;t know man could build such things.<br/><br/>Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men&#39;s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",

This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can&#39;t even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can&#39;t get why they didn&#39;t gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!",

I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.<br/><br/>I&#39;m a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn&#39;t even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese&#39;s, respective visions.<br/><br/>All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese&#39;s long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",

They teach you there&#39;s a boundary line to music. But, man, there&#39;s no boundary line to art.&quot; <br/><br/>Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn&#39;t expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger. <br/><br/>This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art<br/><br/>&quot;Beautiful&quot; because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT. <br/><br/>Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won&#39;t say &quot;good job&quot; but rather &quot;thank you&quot;, to the promising Franco-American director Damien Chazelle﻿ for sharing his vision.",

                        "plaidHtml": "One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: &quot;the movies of the nineties&quot; and this movie wasn&#39;t included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one&#39;s tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991). For others it will be &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) while others will praise to the skies &quot;Se7en&quot; (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It&#39;s a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.<br/><br/>The average viewer who watches &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey&#39;s convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won&#39;t regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer&#39;s flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey&#39;s declarations and it&#39;s obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It&#39;s up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.<br/><br/>From Spacey&#39;s story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer&#39;s directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor&#39;s edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There&#39;s also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience&#39;s curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won&#39;t weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer&#39;s flick, it doesn&#39;t disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there&#39;s more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this &quot;coup de theatre&quot; veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.<br/><br/>Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don&#39;t neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn&#39;t stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it&#39;s necessary to underscore the fact that they&#39;re lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.<br/><br/>A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...",

                        "plaidHtml": "Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn&#39;t familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn&#39;t seen it?<br/><br/>I&#39;ve been watching &#39;Casablanca&#39; over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.<br/><br/>But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of &#39;Casablanca&#39; first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (&quot;This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!&quot;) or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (&quot;What watch?&quot;).<br/><br/>But &#39;Casablanca&#39; is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than &#39;Casablanca&#39;? &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39; is on my mind here, and &#39;All About Eve&#39; and &#39;Sunset Blvd.&#39; come close, too, but still I think &#39;Casablanca&#39; tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it&#39;s unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (&quot;I was misinformed.&quot;) and Claude Rains (&quot;I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here&quot;). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of &#39;Die Wacht am Rhein&#39; and &#39;La Marseillaise&#39; is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin&#39;s &#39;The Great Dictator&#39;), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who&#39;ve never seen &#39;Casablanca&#39;. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn&#39;t have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?<br/><br/>About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart&#39;s and Ingrid Bergman&#39;s chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains&#39; terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I&#39;d love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in &#39;Schindler&#39;s List&#39;. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick&#39;s Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he&#39;s a joy whenever he&#39;s on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (&quot;Vultures everywhere!&quot;) accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the &quot;What watch&quot;-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, &quot;being a German, he would have taken it anyway&quot;. His performance is simply criminally overlooked.<br/><br/>So is there a weakest link in &#39;Casablanca&#39;? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in &#39;Casablanca&#39;, too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn&#39;t come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I&#39;m almost ashamed that I&#39;m so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.<br/><br/>So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we&#39;re desperate to see a great film: We&#39;ll always have Casablanca!",

I hesitated at first, but then I said &quot;Oh well, I&#39;ll give it a try.&quot; At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I&#39;ve ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.<br/><br/>This movie isn&#39;t your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I&#39;m not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn&#39;t trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.<br/><br/>I am kind of upset, that this movie didn&#39;t get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi&#39;s best movie they have ever released.<br/><br/>I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.<br/><br/>An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.<br/><br/>Quite Simply 10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC&#39;s Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo,&quot; Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks&#39; Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.<br/><br/>The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of &quot;The 47 Ronin.&quot; The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.<br/><br/>Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.<br/><br/>It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan&#39;s armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.<br/><br/>The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like &quot;Downfall (Der Untergang),&quot; it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.<br/><br/>The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.<br/><br/>The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",

                        "plaidHtml": "&quot;Modern Times&quot; is in my top 5 films, and #2 in my list of favorite comedies. Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being, nevermind film maker, that ever lived. I first saw this treasure about 8 years ago, and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny, and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film. &quot;Modern Times&quot; passed my test with flying colors. I laughed hysterically from start to finish. Each and every scene is innovative, well thought out, and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed. Among my favorite scenes are the &quot;automatic worker-feeding machine&quot;; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food, thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store. No special effects or computer animation, just pure, simple, genius.<br/><br/>The storyline in &quot;Modern Times&quot; is purposefully naive, a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films. Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros. cartoon, which coming from me is a sincere compliment. The level of physical comedy in &quot;Modern Times&quot; is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and others.<br/><br/>Finally, as was the case with most of his later films, &quot;Modern Times&quot; is a serious social commentary. Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released. In fact, it is arguably even more relevant today, and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be. &quot;Modern Times&quot; is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society. The opening scene, which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep, is Chaplin&#39;s warning against standardization, mechanization, and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality. Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden, because despite his enormous success and wealth, he never forgot where he came from. In the end, &quot;Modern Times&quot; is a reminder that no matter how bad things are, you can still smile. Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other, and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films. Its up to us to keep his legacy alive.",

                        "plaidHtml": "In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.<br/><br/>Are you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.<br/><br/>But are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can&#39;t you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.<br/><br/>The almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it&#39;s uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.<br/><br/>Charles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo&#39;s in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.<br/><br/>In a tavern the man meets Manuel &#39;Cheyenne&#39; Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn&#39;t be an overrated luxury.<br/><br/>The &#39;damsel in distress&#39; (although she isn&#39;t in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn&#39;t want to cross.<br/><br/>They are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.<br/><br/>And finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you&#39;d like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!<br/><br/>The soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes&#39; theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I&#39;d do it.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up.

The usage of an excellent background score is a trademark of his movies and this movie is not at all a different case.<br/><br/>He is also a master in getting best performances out of children and adolescents. Marco Leonardi was the pick of the whole cast. Also watch Melena for those trademarks of Tornatore.<br/><br/>The character of Alfredo is one of the most unforgettable characters. The way emotions captured in a camera is way beyond naturality.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie with ultimate teamwork with everyone contributing. I just loved the movie very much.",

I mean, it&#39;s gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I&#39;m a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie &quot;Rear Window&quot;, I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it&#39;s a good reference if it&#39;s from The Simpsons.<br/><br/>&quot;Rear Window&quot; is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years, this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart, he&#39;s just so great as L.B., I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn&#39;t even try, but you can&#39;t help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn&#39;t have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he&#39;s a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza, she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility, and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.&#39;s heart.<br/><br/>I loved the ending, to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza. I won&#39;t tell, you&#39;ll just have to trust me, it was a brilliant way to breath and smile again after all the suspense and drama. &quot;Rear Window&quot; is a true classic and I&#39;m extremely grateful to the reviewers of IMDb who saw this movie and gave it great reviews, and the writers of The Simpsons! If it were not for you guys, I nor other members of my generation would probably not view it! Let&#39;s keep this classic alive! <br/><br/>10/10",

When &#39;Alien&#39; was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as &#39;Star Wars&#39; did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and &#39;Alien&#39; had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since &#39;2001: A Space Odyssey&#39; in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, &#39;Alien&#39; has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott&#39;s best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film.",

MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn&#39;t make a bad movie, and I&#39;m not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.<br/><br/>That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it&#39;s a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin&#39;s little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It&#39;s a monument to understated sentimentality.<br/><br/>To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it&#39;s that ending that makes us all love this movie.",

                        "plaidHtml": "MEMENTO / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>\tHow is this for a scenario? A man breaks into your house in the middle of the night. He kills your wife and leaves you with brain injuries. Furious, you pledge your life to track down and kill whoever is responsible. There is just one problem: after the head injury, you are no longer capable of creating new memories; everything before the accident is crystal clear, but now you cannot remember anything past several minutes.<br/><br/>\tNow chew on this: what happens to guilt if you cannot remember what you did? How can a person have emotions if he does not know where they came from? How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?<br/><br/>\n\t&quot;Memento&quot; wins this year&#39;s prize for inducing the most audience participation. Not only is the film thought-provoking and unusually absorbing, but it also places us in the main character&#39;s shoes. How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.<br/><br/>\tOther characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from &quot;The Matrix&quot;), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from &quot;The Matrix&quot;), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard&#39;s experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard&#39;s. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.  <br/><br/>\t&quot;Memento&quot; is smart and imaginative. It doesn&#39;t pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information. <br/><br/>In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film&#39;s actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot. <br/><br/>&quot;Memento&quot; is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-&quot;Memento&quot; doesn&#39;t provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. &quot;Memento&quot; is one of the year&#39;s most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original.",

I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.<br/><br/>This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very &quot;virtual&quot;, for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life &quot;grit.&quot; The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.<br/><br/>The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.<br/><br/>WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it&#39;s previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can&#39;t wait to see what the future brings...",

Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.<br/><br/>The dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler&#39;s List and Serg Lopez in Pan&#39;s Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists&#39; lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.<br/><br/>Few films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others&#39; lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It&#39;s rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here&#39;s looking at you, best film of the year.",

It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film&#39;s history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson&#39;s career/real life cameos/DeMille&#39;s involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today&#39;s film writers should take note.  If that weren&#39;t enough, there&#39;s even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).<br/><br/>One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era).  What&#39;s interesting is that now, so many years later, we&#39;re looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950&#39;s is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920&#39;s is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don&#39;t think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today&#39;s audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don&#39;t often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.<br/><br/>In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): &quot;...we didn&#39;t need dialogue; we had faces&quot;, I&#39;d like to also add that they &quot;didn&#39;t need movies; they had films.&quot;<br/><br/>They truly don&#39;t make them like this anymore. 10/10",

He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn&#39;t deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It&#39;s only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.<br/><br/>This is one of Jack Nicholson&#39;s finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she&#39;s genuinely filled with fear - but doesn&#39;t have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn&#39;t have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack&#39;s show.<br/><br/>The story doesn&#39;t stick to King&#39;s novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick&#39;s Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.<br/><br/>Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It&#39;s one of the best examples of his masterful touch.<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Back at the dawn of the talkie era, Charlie Chaplin defended his decision not to start making sound films by saying &quot;The moment the little tramp talks, he&#39;s dead&quot;. He was right of course. His comic persona was the creation of an era in cinema when words and voices were irrelevant. The little tramp&#39;s appeal lay entirely in how he did things, not in what he was supposed to be saying. And yet it was inevitable that if Chaplin wanted to continue in the business he would have to cave in eventually. Besides Chaplin&#39;s agenda was itself changing, and he had now reached a point in his life where he really wanted to speak to the world.<br/><br/>Many of the early scenes in The Great Dictator seem to prove Chaplin&#39;s fears about sound film. The slapstick has lost its flow, looking forced and awkward. And it appears Chaplin has no real idea how to write or direct dialogue. Sometimes characters make some banal little comment on the action as if simply to fill up the silence. Even worse things happen when Chaplin attempts verbal humour, resorting to feeble puns like the one about the gas keeping him awake all night (not that puns are necessarily bad, just that Chaplin isn&#39;t very good at them). Above all, the visual and verbal business is poorly integrated, with a badly-timed stop-start feel. It makes it particularly jarring after a dialogue scene to see this ageing version of the little tramp doing some of his old moves, such as teetering on one foot as he runs into a squad of stormtroopers. These scenes are unlikely to raise more than a titter, and are a sad testament to the fact that this familiar character was past his prime and out of time.<br/><br/>But this is a tale of two Charlies. For the first time in decades Chaplin creates a new character for himself in dictator Adenoid Hynkel. And the great thing about Hynkel is that he sidesteps Chaplin&#39;s inability with comedy in words but still makes use of comedy in sound. The dictator&#39;s cod-Germanic speech is part silly-voice, part linguistic nonsense and it is very, very funny. It actually adds to the humour that no-one else in the picture speaks it, and that Hynkel mostly lapses into it in moments of anger, as if it was some involuntary anxiety-driven affectation. The other great thing about Hynkel is that he is one of Chaplin&#39;s great works of satire. The nonsense language is of course a lampooning of Hitler&#39;s forceful speechmaking, but the parody continues through everything Hynkel does. Take for example when he has finished posing with the baby, and rather disgustedly wipes his hand clean. He does it with the same stiff-faced disdain that Hitler always displayed in public, but the character&#39;s puffed-up austerity is also being punctured by the fact that he&#39;s just got his hand covered in wee wee. The little tramp, a creation of and for the silent era, could not make the transition to sound. But Hynkel is a creation of and for the sound era, and he works fantastically.<br/><br/>As the picture unfolds, it begins to gain maturity and clarity, not to mention comic brilliance. Jack Oakie&#39;s Napoloni makes a perfect partner for Hynkel, and their antics together are like the Marx Brothers at their most riotous. Napoloni is also a work of satire equal to Hynkel, with Oakie working in many of Mussolini&#39;s less dignified mannerisms, such as curling his lip and bulging his eyes like he&#39;s trying to squeeze out a fart. While Chaplin&#39;s direction is at its most overt and showy, he also cleverly and subtly gears his compositions towards ridicule, making the most of those tall set designs to show off the dictator as some little twerp. And finally, the picture acquires the poignancy that made Chaplin&#39;s silent features stand out, this time with an extra bite in the seriousness of its message. It is then that you realise Chaplin knew his little tramp was finished, and yet that he needed him here to deliver his point. By subjecting him to sound, Chaplin sacrifices his alter-ego, making a means to speak his mind to the public who had loved him.",

The original short story(rather unremarkable, actually)has been expanded into a magnificent example of Hollywood entertainment at its best. In addition to perhaps the finest line-up of character actors ever assembled(next to Cukor&#39;s David Copperfield, that is), we get Laughton and Dietrich at the top of their form. The person who criticised Lanchester&#39;s performance as &quot;annoying&quot; missed the point entirely. Miss Plimsoll is meant to be annoying! Also, what&#39;s with all the bad-mouthing of Tyrone Power? &quot;Hammy&quot;; &quot;terrible&quot;; &quot;worst performance ever&quot;. These are the perceptive IMDb reviews? Only one of you got it right: it&#39;s hammy because Leonard Vole is the one acting, not Power! For 95% of the film, the character is dissembling, only showing his true colors at the end. Of course it looks hammy: Vole isn&#39;t a born actor like his wife. And to all those know-it-alls who called this film mediocre and predictable, I look forward to your upcoming film projects which I&#39;m sure will be paragons of excellence and worthy to be set alongside classics of the golden age.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Updated review 4-9-19<br/><br/>I&#39;ve now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn&#39;t for everyone. Let&#39;s break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.<br/><br/>If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they&#39;re great.<br/><br/>The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.<br/><br/>The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.<br/><br/>Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I&#39;ve watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.<br/><br/>Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.<br/><br/>I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I&#39;m working or doing something else and I&#39;ll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. &quot;The most visually stunning movie I&#39;ve ever seen&quot;. Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn&#39;t use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they&#39;re seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it&#39;s just simply too much for some people. I get that.<br/><br/>As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren&#39;t many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.<br/><br/>Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.<br/><br/>What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton&#39;s dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they&#39;re all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that &#39;feel the most like a comic book&#39;, you&#39;d probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.<br/><br/>But they aren&#39;t literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really &#39;just cartoons&#39;, and I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way. They&#39;re simply cartoon versions of comic books.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It&#39;s an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.<br/><br/>This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I&#39;m-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.<br/><br/>Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like &quot;oh wow! It&#39;s a comic book come to life!&quot;? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.<br/><br/>But here&#39;s the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a &quot;here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!&quot;<br/><br/>My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I&#39;ve built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I&#39;ve gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It&#39;s that great.",

I mean: don&#39;t get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see &#39;Dr.Strangelove&#39;. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick&#39;s later works, there&#39;s a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I&#39;m guessing that Seller&#39;s love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

Just getting out of it, I&#39;ve never been so awake. <br/><br/>Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan&#39;s other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead &quot;enforcer&quot;, but one of the criminal masterminds behind &quot;Gotham&#39;s Reckoning&quot;, coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.<br/><br/>The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine&#39;s performance in both presence and absence.<br/><br/>Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could&#39;ve been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role. <br/><br/>If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I&#39;m happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary. <br/><br/>I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I&#39;ve never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It&#39;s a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.<br/><br/>From here, I&#39;m not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.<br/><br/>10/10",

The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character&#39;s name sounds like Aldo Ray and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970&#39;s sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino&#39;s trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He&#39;s clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don&#39;t read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That&#39;s how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time.

                        "plaidHtml": "When the two worlds of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart collide in Milos Forman&#39;s Amadeus, it is anything but a symphony. As the court composer of the Emperor of Austria, all Salieri desires are fame and recognition as a composer; it is all he had wanted his whole life. When he learns that Mozart, whose name he had known as long as he can remember, is going to come to the court to play, Salieri cannot wait to meet the outstanding and righteous man that he knows he must be. However, when Salieri learns that Mozart is a young, crude, and unrefined young man, endowed with all the talent and ability that he ever wanted and strived for, it plants a seed of jealousy that soon grows into bitter resentment and hatred, not only for Mozart, but also towards God. Salieri&#39;s desire to get rid of him is seemingly boundless as he plots and schemes for Mozart&#39;s demise. It is no wonder why Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with 5-Star performances by F. Murry Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart. Amadeus is an emotionally charged and tragic piece, a story of the life of one of the world&#39;s most famous composers, as seen through the eyes of his worst enemy.",

The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. I don&#39;t know about everybody else, but the ending did make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.<br/><br/>I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in.

                        "plaidHtml": "What impresses me the most about the film, as the title makes apparent, is that it&#39;s a German made film about a German U-boat. Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition (especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis), but these characters are so well developed and played like human-beings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.<br/><br/>I love the flow and pacing of the Director&#39;s Cut; it takes its time, and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula &quot;first major plot point at minute 12&quot; cookie-cutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I&#39;m interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.<br/><br/>The underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.<br/><br/>And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it&#39;s a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.<br/><br/>Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I&#39;ve ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he&#39;s forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film&#39;s characters and their portrayals. It&#39;s both disappointing and satisfying that I&#39;m not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I&#39;ve reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these &quot;heroes&quot;, the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.<br/><br/>Another aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these &quot;talked about&quot; scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.<br/><br/>I can go on for a long while: Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film&#39;s lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I&#39;ll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Studio Ghibli has been Japan&#39;s leading anime Production Company since the 1980&#39;s, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind&quot; (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.<br/><br/>The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe&#39;s wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka&#39;s efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side&#39;s bid for allegiance.<br/><br/>&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki&#39;s best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, &quot;Mononoke&quot; has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters&#39; nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli&#39;s other works, which were aimed mostly at children.<br/><br/>Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film&#39;s wonder, because Miyazaki&#39;s true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi&#39;s music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.<br/><br/>Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg&#39;s &quot;E.T.&quot;, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; became Japan&#39;s No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.",

The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams&#39; subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon&#39;s frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10",

Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don&#39;t compare a Picasso to Michelangelo&#39;s Sixteen Chapel either, do you?<br/><br/>What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He&#39;s one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. <br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don&#39;t think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn&#39;t want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910&#39;s - 1930&#39;s - 1960&#39;s), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director&#39;s cut. <br/><br/>The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn&#39;t said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn&#39;t left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn&#39;t a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You&#39;ll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you&#39;ll find this one of the best movies you&#39;ve ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",

I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I&#39;m repelled. It&#39;s probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, &quot;Please don&#39;t take us seriously, we like to sing and dance.&quot; Or even more ridiculous, &quot;Let&#39;s not fight, let&#39;s settle this dispute with a song and dance.&quot; Forget about suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don&#39;t break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn&#39;t last though, but by then they&#39;ve got you.<br/><br/>With such memorable tunes as these, it&#39;s hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you&#39;re swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it&#39;s raining. One thing&#39;s for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.<br/><br/>They simply don&#39;t make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film&#39;s theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by &quot;talkies&quot; with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.<br/><br/>One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can&#39;t get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special. Considering my feelings about musicals, it would have to take a film of this one&#39;s caliber to make me sit up and take notice.",

This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it&#39;s entertainment value, and more importantly, it&#39;s educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it&#39;s honesty and unforgiving lessons.",

It, in true Kurosawa style (one which Stanley Kubrick matched blow-for-blow, seeming to complement one another in their stunning gifts to the cinema), stands as a fable showing the differences and tensions which the coexistance of different classes creates.<br/><br/>Gondo, the rich on high, receives torment from those who live below him, being literally perched upon a hill, overlooking the city in a feudalistic way, in which the king&#39;s palace gazes down upon the serfs below.  As the kidnapper says, &quot;it&#39;s hot as hell down here.  But you wouldn&#39;t know that, you have air conditioning.&quot;  Thus we see the parallels pile upon each other: it is about class warfare but also shows the differences between heaven and hell; and Gondo makes both a descent and ascent simultaneously.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but the truth is complicated, and I won&#39;t go into it here, but take my word as it stands: this is an amazing piece of film. See it now or regret it!  Every Kurosawa film is sublime.",

The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.<br/><br/>I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.<br/><br/>This movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn&#39;t any. I&#39;m sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre...

The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.<br/><br/>None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.<br/><br/>Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.<br/><br/>In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",

I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don&#39;t mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.<br/><br/>I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn&#39;t have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.<br/><br/>I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.<br/><br/>I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#39;s performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.<br/><br/>Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and it&#39;s Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to &quot;clear&quot; the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven&#39;t been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to &quot;join the fight&quot; he get much more he had bargained for. It&#39;s a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. There&#39;s no catharsis (this is not Schindler&#39;s List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village&#39;s destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. &quot;Come And See&quot; is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR&#39;s beginning) or &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; seems just artificial. This is the real thing!",

The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it&#39;s characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it&#39;s movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate.",

                        "plaidHtml": "&quot;The Hunt&quot; is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.<br/><br/>To delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I&#39;ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I&#39;ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.<br/><br/>This is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen&#39;s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won&#39;t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp&#39;s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she&#39;s in.<br/><br/>The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children&#39;s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.<br/><br/>This is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund&#39;s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer&#39;s imagination, which chill to the bone.<br/><br/>Hollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn&#39;t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>&quot;The Hunt&quot; was easily the saddest film I&#39;ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It&#39;s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that&#39;s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.<br/><br/>It was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but &quot;The Hunt&quot; is one of the most affecting and emotional films I&#39;ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.",

But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O&#39;Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O&#39;Toole&#39;s eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors.

I must say, it&#39;s great. The plot is great, and the way it&#39;s told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won&#39;t reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I&#39;ve seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can&#39;t praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It&#39;s only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn&#39;t move at all. When there weren&#39;t great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn&#39;t seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can&#39;t do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I&#39;m writing this, it&#39;s #11. That&#39;s pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven&#39;t seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don&#39;t let the fact that it&#39;s old and black &amp; white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child, waiting anxiously for her to return from school.  Her hope, and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door.  While down in the streets of Berlin, her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat.  We know what&#39;s going to happen, but it&#39;s still horrific to watch.<br/><br/>Fritz Lang, you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld, the police, and a single man holding an entire city hostage, and done with such precision and pre-noir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to end.<br/><br/>But this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  it&#39;s about the mob, employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice. Apparently, the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as well.<br/><br/>It&#39;s not only a great crime story, and perhaps the first physiological thriller (the murderer is schizophrenic) but there&#39;s comments to be made here about the nature of justice, and who should best dispense it.<br/><br/>In all, not only a trail-blazing classic, but THE trail-blazing classic.",

It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children&#39;s park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe&#39;s plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe&#39;s beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...",

There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcock&#39;s best-known set pieces.  It&#39;s capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for &quot;Psycho&quot;.<br/><br/>Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun.  As one of the man-on-the-run characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations.  The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.<br/><br/>The story is one of Hitchcock&#39;s most exciting.  It&#39;s slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at.  Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely.  At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcock&#39;s mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.<br/><br/>With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director.  You can watch it several times and still find it just as entertaining.",

Case in point is the selection for May - the 1960 Oscar winner for Best Picture, THE APARTMENT - a &quot;love story&quot; with some comedy and some dark dramatic moments and themes. A very tricky combination of items that are bundled together, brilliantly, by a master of the craft.<br/><br/>THE APARTMENT tells the story of nebbish office worker C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon in an Oscar nominated performance, more on that later) who is talked into lending his apartment to higher-ups in his company so they can carry out extra-marital affairs. When one of the affairs goes wrong, Baxter is forced to &quot;clean up the mess&quot;.<br/><br/>Written and Directed by the GREAT Billy WIlder (SOME LIKE IT HOT, SUNSET BOULEVARD), The Apartment is more than a love story, more than a look into the vacuous lives of those anonymous office workers, it is a look into the lives of those who are victims of abuse of power. Wilder, rightfully so, won the Oscar for Best Director and Best Screenplay for this film. The Apartment is strongly written and directed not flinching at the deep subject matter while also balancing things out with moments of comedy and joy, turning what could have been a dour, dark subject into a more joyous exploration of true humanity and love rising through the corruption and abuse of power heaped upon them.<br/><br/>In the lead role of CC Baxter, Lemmon is perfectly cast. Starting as a pure comedic character who is set upon by a world too strong for him, his character slowly turns sharper, deeper, more serious and more real as the film progresses. Lemmon was nominated for the Oscar for his performance - and rightfully so. I had to look up who beat him out for the statue and found out it was Burt Lancaster&#39;s powerhouse performance in ELMER GANTRY, so I can&#39;t really argue about this (but I digress).<br/><br/>Matching Lemmon beat for beat is Shirley MacLaine, the wronged girl who&#39;s &quot;issues&quot; (I&#39;m not going to spoil what happens, if you haven&#39;t seen this) are at the heart of this film - and at the heart of Lemmon&#39;s character. MacLaine is charming and tragic in this role and she, too, was nominated for an Oscar (for Best Actress losing to Elizabeth Taylor for Butterfield 8). Rounding out the cast was a pre-MY 3 SONS Fred MacMurray (as the Exec who abuses both Lemmon&#39;s and MacLaine&#39;s characters). He was terrific as this cad, and thought for sure that he would have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but that honor went to Jack Kruschen as Lemmon&#39;s neighbor in the apartment building where they both lived. I am fine with that but preferred MacMurray&#39;s performance. Also showing up are such great character actors as Ray Walston (MY FAVORITE MARTIAN), David Lewis (GENERAL HOSPITAL), Willard Waterman (THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE) and David White (Larry Tate in BEWITCHED) as other Execs using The Apartment for their purposes.<br/><br/>This is a terrific motion picture and if you haven&#39;t seen it (or if you haven&#39;t seen it in quite sometime), I highly recommend you check it out (it is shown on the Turner Classic Movie channel on a fairly regular basis). It certainly shows a slice of life during the MAD MEN days that just doesn&#39;t exist anymore - and also presents a type of film, and a type of filmmaker, that just doesn&#39;t exist today.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A+<br/><br/>10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",

                        "plaidHtml": "To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.<br/><br/>This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!<br/><br/>Compared to most other films &quot;Amelie&quot; (and I will stick to &quot;Amelie&quot; since &quot;Le Fabuleux destin d&#39;Amélie Poulain&quot; is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing &quot;Amelie&quot; criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us &quot;Alien 4&quot; back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful &quot;Delicatessen&quot; in 1991.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry &quot;Amelie&quot; solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.<br/><br/>I could go on forever about &quot;Amelie&quot;. It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, &quot;Amelie&quot; made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.<br/><br/>I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...",

                        "plaidHtml": "&quot;A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.&quot; -Mark Twain<br/><br/>&#39;Classic&#39; seems to be the word used to describe &quot;Scarface&quot;, Brian DePalma&#39;s 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida&#39;s drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film &#39;an epic gangster classic&#39; or &#39;eptiome of gangster films.&#39; When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.<br/><br/>First off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma&#39;s directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. &#39;Tragedy&#39; would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it&#39;s drug usage, it&#39;s violence, it&#39;s dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn&#39;t make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.<br/><br/>Next on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a &#39;gangster film&#39;. It has it&#39;s share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It&#39;s not like &quot;Aliens&quot;- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. <br/><br/>This being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn&#39;t think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma&#39;s direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping&#39; fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in &quot;Grease 2&quot; she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony&#39;s sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina&#39;s torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. <br/><br/>This reviewer learned one main thing when watching &quot;Scarface&quot; for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey&#39;s on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real &quot;Scarface.&quot;",

                        "plaidHtml": "Want to see where one of the modern era&#39;s hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.<br/><br/>Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year&#39;s brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.<br/><br/>Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad&#39;s play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we&#39;re drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.<br/><br/>There&#39;s not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve&#39;s deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.<br/><br/>Saying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they&#39;ve never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.<br/><br/>The film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>For any fans of Villeneuve&#39;s work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era&#39;s great filmmakers.<br/><br/>5 swimming pools out of 5",

                        "plaidHtml": "&#39;Heat,&#39; a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann&#39;s sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, &#39;Heat&#39; is arguably one of the best crime dramas.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna&#39;s personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna&#39;s marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the &quot;remnants of dead people.&quot;  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna&#39;s story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley&#39;s story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.<br/><br/>In addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley&#39;s human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine&#39;s daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.<br/><br/>And Michael Mann&#39;s direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.<br/><br/>Because of these and other well done aspects, &#39;Heat&#39; is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young &quot;wilderness explorer&quot; Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.<br/><br/>The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.<br/><br/>Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.<br/><br/>What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a &quot;bird&quot; named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl&#39;s backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.<br/><br/>But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up&#39;s favour.<br/><br/>But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl&#39;s facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).<br/><br/>I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.<br/><br/>10/10.",

                        "plaidHtml": "After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book&#39;s spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it&#39;s interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would&#39;ve shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book&#39;s counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book&#39;s early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a &quot;must-see,&quot; as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "The Sting.<br/><br/>The Sting (1973) is one of everybody&#39;s favorite films. Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again, this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.<br/><br/>The intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago. It tells the story of grifters, Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, respectively. They con the bad guy, Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw. And at every turn, they con the audience as well.<br/><br/>The poker game is five card draw (&#39;straight poker&#39; in the film) and is set on a train traveling from New York to Chicago. Newman and Redford are on the train along with Shaw. The game has been set up by Shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. We don&#39;t know how Newman and Redford know exactly what day and what train Shaw is taking from New York to Chicago, but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. Shaw is a known card cheater, but Newman will prove to be a better one. Once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. This time, we&#39;ll love every minute of it.<br/><br/>Newman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game, through the conductor. He arrives sober, but apparently inebriated. It is the perfect act, consummately played in a boozy, needling performance by Paul Newman. <br/><br/>Shaw&#39;s character is a known cold decker (a &#39;cold deck&#39; is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands pre-arranged to break one of the players)&#39; and Newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game.<br/><br/>One of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. Newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. During the play of hands, we see Newman hold the cards close to his vest and, at least once, his cards disappear briefly below table level, out of sight, and back again. Newman knows Shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards, and so Newman is gathering and holding out jacks.<br/><br/>Newman immediately insults Shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game, thus making sure Shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. When Shaw goes to the men&#39;s room to arrange to fix the cold deck, Newman knows the time has come. (In real life, cold decks were nearly always arranged in men&#39;s rooms. They should have had a dedicated stall marked &#39;coolers made here&#39;.)<br/><br/>The game is three handed at this point. Shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. In filming the cold decking, the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck, then there&#39;s a cut in the continuity. Then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in Shaw&#39;s lap, leaving the cold deck on the table. I guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot.<br/><br/>The detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. Newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest, implying something is happening. But we never see Newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards.<br/><br/>Newman is dealt trip threes and Shaw is dealt a pair of nines. The third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. Newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. Shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades.<br/><br/>The planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. After the cards are dealt, the cards on top of the deck are, in order, a three, the six of hearts, two nines and the ten of spades. It doesn&#39;t matter whether Newman draws one or two cards, he&#39;ll make his four threes and, in either case, Shaw, in drawing three cards, will make his four nines.<br/><br/>Now, here&#39;s the unlikely trick. Newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. It would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he&#39;s held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won&#39;t have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable.<br/><br/>Shaw&#39;s problem is that he can&#39;t call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin, Shaw says to his lackey, &#39;What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others?&#39;<br/><br/>Shaw was able to get $10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.<br/><br/>The film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However, we never see Newman clean up. So, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises.<br/><br/>Despite its faults, the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.<br/><br/>Silver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com",

                        "plaidHtml": "We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born. The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Lang&#39;s &#39;Metropolis&#39; are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given. The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upper-class and operated by slave-like poor. The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens. The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God. The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan. These elements can be found in this film&#39;s ancestors &#39;Frankenstein&#39;, &#39;Batman&#39;, &#39;Gattaca&#39; and the cities of &#39;Blade Runner&#39;, &#39;Star Wars&#39; and &#39;The Fifth Element&#39;. All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Lang&#39;s work.<br/><br/>&#39;Metropolis&#39; has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made, certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes. After its success in 1927 the film has had an uneasy time. It&#39;s pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre. One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring. Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in 1927. Unless a lost version surfaces (as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentino&#39;s 1922 film &#39;Beyond the Rocks&#39;) the complete work my never be seen again. The restored version released on DVD in 2001 was based on a digital restoration at 2K resolution from all available sources. It&#39;s the best version that I&#39;ve seen and I would highly recommend that one if you haven&#39;t seen the film. The worst is a 1994 print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration, the film in grainy and difficult to see, it doesn&#39;t even have a soundtrack. I call that one the worst because I&#39;m still a little ambivalent about the 1984 restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting (good), sound effects (not so good) and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy, Freddy Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Adam Ant and Pat Benatar (yuck!).<br/><br/>Those who study the film (myself included) find the story impenetrable. Some films you can easily decipher but &#39;Metropolis&#39; has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that it&#39;s hard to pin it down as a whole. Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the film&#39;s chaotic nature. It takes place in the future (restored versions offer title cards that suggest that it&#39;s the year 2000 but I don&#39;t go by that) in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers (the Gothic, sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry). The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives, dancing in their penthouses and spending their money. The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine. Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step. They don&#39;t so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses&#39; slaves building his pyramids. The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another. One person that isn&#39;t ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his office.<br/><br/>His son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the worker&#39;s children. Curious, he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there. The woman is Maria, a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be found.<br/><br/>Freder uncovers a plot by Rotwang, the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms. This leads to the film&#39;s most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs. Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzy.<br/><br/>Then all Hell breaks loose, but the rest I must leave to you to discover.<br/><br/>Lang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou. In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film (and therefore less successful), the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not. He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers. At one point Freder, disguised as a worker, witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen. Another suggests an odd device, a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around it&#39;s edge. The machine doesn&#39;t seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless day.<br/><br/>The film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism, astonishing in its use of light and shadow. One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in. Another brilliant moment comes with Maria&#39;s erotic dance as the men gawk, the camera filled with their moist eyes. This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home video.<br/><br/>Other moments have deeper resonance. There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves. Walking to work they march with their heads down, dressed in uniforms and caps. It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps. There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler. More obvious are Lang&#39;s biblical references. The rise of the city parallels Maria&#39;s retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel. The giant pentagram in Rotwang&#39;s lab as he plays God. The breathtaking image of the plague-bringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe. The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself. There is even a Christ-like quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakers.<br/><br/>These elements and images are brought to the film because of Lang&#39;s insistence on no less then absolute perfection. He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster, working his cast and crew like a dictator. He cast some 20,000 extras (1500 of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone) and worked them from morning till night. The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold. Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night. Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times, once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with him.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, this film all great films invite lengthy discussions. It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways, as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over. But when you get down to it the best way to view &#39;Metropolis&#39; is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of it&#39;s time, Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it&#39;s so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it&#39;s a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There&#39;s really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane&#39;s outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.<br/><br/>Overall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it&#39;s fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.<br/><br/>8/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "When a film evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. It could be argued that it is easier to replicate the recent past than the distant on film,  and in a sense this is true. Costumes, language, and the necessary absence of the modern in &quot;period pieces&quot; make them expensive and difficult to film. But couldn&#39;t it be argued that it is just as difficult to make a film about more recent periods? I have no knowledge of how a Victorian era table was set, or what a knight really spoke like; we are subject to the directors view of reality. But what if a good deal of your audience lived through the time you are portraying, as in the case of the 1950&#39;s? I can even envision my grandfather coming back from WW2 to a booming economy, and living in the world Curtis Hanson created.<br/><br/>The real genus of this film is that it creates not only a physical world, but one with all the politics, corruption, racism and inequity of the time. As a result we feel the characters motivations and understand their faults all  the better; Bud White, Ed Exley, Lynn Bracken and Lana Turner all live here. <br/><br/>This film, like others that make us believe we are there for two hours (and $7.50), will endure. I was thinking a  perfect double feature would be with Chinatown, another film that will stand the test of time.",

The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann&#39;s swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that&#39;s how good it is, but that&#39;s not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese&#39;s own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese&#39;s best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

                        "plaidHtml": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy&#39;s dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit &amp; charm along with Indy&#39;s usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; isn&#39;t by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix&#39; laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.<br/><br/>This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg&#39;s output: A young Indiana &quot;beginning&quot; his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat &quot;You lost today kid, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to like it.&quot; and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There&#39;s a bit of kissing/banter, and it&#39;s implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there&#39;s ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn&#39;t need another sequel after third release. There&#39;s nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy&#39;s Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it&#39;s up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

                        "plaidHtml": "Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, &quot;SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!&quot; What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.<br/><br/>Snatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie.  Let me repeat that.  This movie is crazy!  Imagine the Mr. Toad&#39;s Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend.  Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie has it&#39;s problems.  First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch&#39;s predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes.  The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater.  I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn&#39;t last.<br/><br/>If any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can.  Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it&#39;s funny, you&#39;ll laugh till your lungs burst.  It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same &quot;slamming victim&#39;s head in a car door&quot; act again.  The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack.  I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn&#39;t have a bigger role.  I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he&#39;s not.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie&#39;s style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.<br/><br/>9/10",

Work is scarce and the opportunities for employment are few and far between. &quot;Ladri Di Biciclette&quot; (translated &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;) is quietly one of the finest films ever produced. It follows one economically distraught man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town, but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes immediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help, believing the bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film the following year (the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949). It is still a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances and mental anguish perfectly. &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; is an excellent production that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5.",

Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, &#39;Spectre&#39; is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman&#39;s score for &#39;Road to Perdition&#39; is a favourite.<br/><br/>&#39;1917&#39; was seen for all those reasons. As well as because of the critical acclaim, with it being considered as one of 2019&#39;s year&#39;s best films. After seeing it, my thoughts are that the acclaim for &#39;1917&#39; is richly deserved in one of the best and most powerful films that year. It did connect a lot with me, due to watching it not long after reading the harrowing war diaries of my great-grandfather (who fought in the war and was mustard gassed and blinded).<br/><br/>First and foremost, &#39;1917&#39; is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins&#39; cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going.<br/><br/>Newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.<br/><br/>Such a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. &#39;1917&#39; benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, brilliant and powerful film. One of the best films personally watched in 2020. 10/10.",

I was expecting it to be good, but it&#39;s actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.<br/><br/>The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I&#39;m not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It&#39;s all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis&#39; (unexplained) absence.<br/><br/>Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it&#39;s done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.<br/><br/>A great watch - I&#39;d highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven&#39;t already.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful &#39;Das Experiment&#39; has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or &#39;The Downfall&#39; to give it it&#39;s English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I&#39;ve ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man&#39;s every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.<br/><br/>It is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang&#39;s main claim to greatness, however - it&#39;s the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed, and all the time you&#39;re watching you can not only see what&#39;s happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene, there&#39;s always the notion that a nation is falling. That&#39;s another thing that&#39;s great about this movie - the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand, we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil; but while we&#39;re watching this almost great nation crumble around it&#39;s leader, it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country, in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi&#39;s; but Der Untergang has managed even that. &#39;The Downfall&#39; is an apt title for this movie, as aside from depicting an important event in history; the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man&#39;s huge downfall, and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed.",

(The music&#39;s almost a major character in this film, in fact.) Stylistically iconic, this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus, we really come to like the co-heroes, Van Cleef and Eastwood - we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain - his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violence-fueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history, for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre, Volonte&#39;s performance rises above the film&#39;s genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don&#39;t see in many films. But so did Van Cleef, whose work in this film is incredible. You&#39;d have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film, but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film, the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works, this film never grows old for me. I am always drawn to watch it again and again for it is of such a depth and complexity that it only reveals more of itself with each viewing.",

                        "plaidHtml": "To start off this review I&#39;d like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman &amp; Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze &quot;You&#39;re not sending me to the cooler&quot;, wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it&#39;s a shame it didn&#39;t start off this way as it might not of died on it&#39;s rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it&#39;s not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne&#39;s past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you&#39;ve not seen it I don&#39;t want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man.",

                        "plaidHtml": "While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplin&#39;s later features, &quot;The Kid&quot; is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair, and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen.  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one, and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicely.<br/><br/>While it&#39;s a fairly simple story, this is one of Chaplin&#39;s most efficiently designed movies.  Every scene either is necessary to the plot, or is very funny for its own sake, or both.  Except for Chaplin and Coogan, most of the other characters (even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance) are just there to advance the plot when needed, and the two leads are allowed to carry the show, which they both do extremely well.<br/><br/>&quot;The Kid&quot; is also impressive in that, while the story is a sentimental one, it strikes an ideal balance, maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos, which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies.  Here, the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorable.<br/><br/>This is one of Chaplin&#39;s very best movies by any measure.  If you enjoy silent comedies, don&#39;t miss it.",

Most comedies about men in womens&#39; clothings have a vulgar humour. This is, of course, not the case for films like &quot;Tootsie&quot; and &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; in which Billy Wilder using black and white instead of colours turns down the importance of the change of sex in many ways so that you can concentrate on the comedy which is extraordinarily well timed with a spiritual dialogue. The acting of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, not to mention Joe E Brown, Pat O&#39;Brien and George Raft is out of this world, and of course it is possible to make a mafia war comical. Some scenes almost remind you of a Marx Brothers&#39; movie. Like when a small berth in a train sleeping car in a few seconds is overcrowded with beautiful girls mixing Manhattan-drinks in their hot-water bottle while Jack Lemmon is desperately trying to remind himself that -- just then -- he is a girl, and Marilyn Monroe in seconds (with her back towards the camera!) produces perfect small, square ice-cubes out of a huge ice block. The music is enchanting like the Marilyn Monroe-songs which are all so well known.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he&#39;s contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian&#39;s insight that felt like I was watching &quot;Intervention&quot; without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone&#39;s Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That&#39;s a testament to Scorsese&#39;s outstanding direction and Terence Winter&#39;s masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They&#39;re like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren&#39;t aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.<br/><br/>A lot of the credit of the film&#39;s overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I&#39;ve never seen him truly &quot;go for it&quot; in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it&#39;s the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90&#39;s in What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he&#39;d been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It&#39;s a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio&#39;s crowning achievement.<br/><br/>As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill&#39;s performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He&#39;s allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he&#39;s not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.<br/><br/>Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan&#39;s outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan&#39;s second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she&#39;ll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she&#39;ll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she&#39;s required to be. She&#39;s the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson&#39;s character in Don Jon.<br/><br/>I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter&#39;s script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn&#39;t make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won&#39;t find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",

The camera swings and swerves and dives between the lines of this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. &quot;I am half the man I&#39;ve ever been&quot; Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark&#39;s strident prosecutor.

However, one of his sons sees this as unwise and is banished by his father, leaving his two brothers in charge of two of the three castles left in their hands. It isn&#39;t long before they are overtaken by greed and eventually betray their father, leaving him in the hands of a philosophical jester and a loyal retainer. This betrayal ultimately leads to war, dividing the family and driving Hidetora insane.<br/><br/>The remarkable script, which contains many of my favorite lines from any film, still manages to break its way through the confinement of subtitles and reveals itself to be one of the richest Kurosawa ever wrote. He has obviously worked equally hard on the look and feel of the film - the cinematography being excellent (example: the long, continuous shot of Saburo&#39;s men charging on horseback across a river).<br/><br/>There&#39;s also something rather frightening about it that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on. The first battle, which is the film&#39;s turning point, is the most horrifying, yet strangely beautiful, battles ever filmed. A good effect used is the loss of sound, with only Toru Takemitsu&#39;s haunting score to be heard. The entire battle lasts less than ten minutes and there is no uplifting or bombastic music to be heard, but in my opinion, it&#39;s Ran&#39;s finest scene, and thus the finest scene ever.<br/><br/>What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors, none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai&#39;s Hidetora, Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede (a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda), and the strangely-named Peter as Kyoami.",

                        "plaidHtml": "As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I&#39;m well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a &quot;moneymaker&quot; for them because he&#39;s the nation&#39;s best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.<br/><br/>Rothstein&#39;s partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.<br/><br/>If you are a gambler or know the &quot;wiseguy&quot; culture, the movie doesn&#39;t have to be explained, while if you aren&#39;t, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;ve stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.<br/><br/>Most of us wouldn&#39;t like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we&#39;ll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film&#39;s nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the &quot;old school&quot; types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",

                        "plaidHtml": "It&#39;s not often a Hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this. On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn&#39;t always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the &quot;stolen kiss on the beach at night&quot; and &quot;Cue the sun!&quot;<br/><br/>In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current &quot;reality TV&quot; obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic &quot;childhood&quot; existence.  How&#39;s it going to end?  Who knows...but things will never be the same.",

                        "plaidHtml": "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. <br/><br/>What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano&#39;s character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis&#39;s character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.<br/><br/>Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I&#39;am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. <br/><br/>Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don&#39;t think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.<br/><br/>Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.<br/><br/>You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I&#39;m not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don&#39;t like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",

                        "plaidHtml": "William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he&#39;s tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture, the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West.<br/><br/>It&#39;s striking that the makers here have lured us in to being firmly on Munney&#39;s side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood&#39;s part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney&#39;s obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way lay the bad guys - in fact salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it&#39;s with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with.<br/><br/>It&#39;s not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is one of the critical characters on show, this even though we didn&#39;t expect that to be the case. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derring-do heroics, gunslingers with a glint in their eye who deal death as some sort of heroic encore. This gives Unforgiven an excellent sleight of hand, for this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions and it&#39;s not controversial to say that this is indeed a good thing.<br/><br/>Eastwood is greatly served by the actors around him, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman (winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before!), Rubinek, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman&#39;s win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot; Daggett, Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction, Best Picture, Best Editing and it was nominated in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green&#39;s cinematography, which now, in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema, can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the Western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, Unforgiven is a lesson in adroit film making, where across the board it works so well. Why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre inside out, he was after all the sole flag bearer for practically 25 years. He learnt from his peers, and thus Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark. An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema, regardless of being a genre fan or not. 10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn&#39;t be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese&#39;s film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane&#39;s already great story.<br/><br/>Shutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you&#39;ve read the novel multiple times, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing &quot;the most dangerous patients,&quot; and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.<br/><br/>I often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall&#39;s The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.<br/><br/>As with Scorsese and DiCaprio&#39;s previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn&#39;t go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That&#39;s not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility&#39;s faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.<br/><br/>However, that mood isn&#39;t sacrificed and &quot;spooky&quot; is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a &quot;best of&quot; collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my &quot;Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows&quot; list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he&#39;s quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn&#39;t mean anything though if you don&#39;t have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn&#39;t among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there&#39;s always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.<br/><br/>With a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn&#39;t rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.<br/><br/>Shutter Island isn&#39;t just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I&#39;ve been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I&#39;ve been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those &quot;in the know.&quot; You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.<br/><br/>At the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I&#39;ll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in &quot;Spoiler&quot; tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing.",

It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character&#39;s soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they&#39;ll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way.",

While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don&#39;t hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I&#39;ve ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick&#39;s fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you&#39;re really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It&#39;s difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It&#39;s almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It&#39;s also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven&#39;t, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I&#39;ve ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it&#39;s so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper &#39;summer blockbuster&#39; that&#39;s incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience&#39;s heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin&#39;s kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he&#39;ll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He&#39;s socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia&#39;s a tough disease, folks - it&#39;s still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says &quot;Russell Crowe&quot;, you&#39;ll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he&#39;s playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he&#39;s unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they&#39;re exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he&#39;s a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a &quot;hunk&quot; - their skills as actors aren&#39;t seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash&#39;s acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that&#39;s the essence of Crowe&#39;s performance. It&#39;s sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she&#39;s the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn&#39;t an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don&#39;t know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I&#39;ll admit it, it got me right here. But it&#39;s okay; I did that old &#39;guy-crying-in-movie-theater&#39; trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won&#39;t think you&#39;re a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it&#39;s certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything&#39;s in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",

This guy&#39;s amazing!<br/><br/>I&#39;ve been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it&#39;s getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch.  Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character  is when he&#39;s in Gonji&#39;s place lying on the floor.  He doesn&#39;t brag, but when he goes into action, that&#39;s it!  As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn&#39;t seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it.  His  demeanor is really amusing and it&#39;s great watching his plan unfold;   how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it&#39;s really funny).  Great thing too is he&#39;s not really a hero and he&#39;s not entirely a villain.  He doesn&#39;t hesitate to kill, but does so methodically.  You also have &quot;characters&quot; including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.<br/><br/>Yojimbo&#39;s mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold <br/><br/>Although &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; is indisputably one of Bogart&#39;s best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie&#39;s director and scenarist, John Huston <br/><br/>Based on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico <br/><br/>Bogart&#39;s Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him <br/><br/>Tim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs&#39;s rage and greed <br/><br/>However, it is the director&#39;s father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time Life can&#39;t surprise him any more He&#39;s already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime Like a faithful dog, he&#39;s along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that&#39;s just a bonus <br/><br/>It is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; one of Warner Brothers&#39; triumphs of the forties",

                        "plaidHtml": "Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there&#39;s nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole&#39; cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he&#39;s ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.<br/><br/>With its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you&#39;re left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it&#39;s a score that&#39;s frightening and precise.<br/><br/>-Eric Statzer",

                        "plaidHtml": "Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie&#39;s Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.<br/><br/>The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he&#39;s lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is &quot;poor&quot;, or that there are &quot;no memorable lines&quot; (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as &quot;steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine&quot;. He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride&#39;s thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker&#39;s tool is not his pen: it&#39;s his eye.",

If you listen to it closely, it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes &amp; woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas).  The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas.  The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking.  I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism, humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story.  As a child growing up in the seventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era.  He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive.",

                        "plaidHtml": "* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)<br/><br/>\nThe Thing<br/><br/>\nDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982<br/><br/>\nLooking back on John Carpenter&#39;s The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.<br/><br/>\nSteven Spielberg&#39;s extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter&#39;s first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.<br/><br/>\nIt then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter&#39;s version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks&#39; version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell&#39;s short story &quot;Who Goes There?&#39; (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.<br/><br/>\nIt opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.<br/><br/>\nThis scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.<br/><br/>\nEnnio Morricone&#39;s moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.<br/><br/>\nA satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.<br/><br/>\nThe budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There&#39;s a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey&#39;s extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.<br/><br/>\nHorror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there&#39;s a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.<br/><br/>An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.<br/><br/>\nWhere Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott&#39;s 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There&#39;s a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott&#39;s in every way.<br/><br/>\nThe husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).<br/><br/>\nWatch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that&#39;s not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.<br/><br/>\nCarpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.",

Well, that easy, it&#39;s just so... PERFECT! <br/><br/>Obviously there are many other great movies, and many other movies I personally also love, but Chinatown has a real spell over me. Other fans have commented here on the story and the spellbinding way that the forlorn and utterly mysterious story unfolds. I certainly agree. <br/><br/>Chinatown&#39;s cinematography and editing? Yes, I agree again! IMO, it&#39;s breathtaking, with pacing so tight that I sit straight up thru the whole movie and my nerves become completely raw every time I watch, listen and FEEL it again. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t think anybody has commented yet on the great choice of the many supporting actors. Each one so well cast and very believable in their roles! You&#39;ve got the entire cast credits list (thank you IMDb) so I won&#39;t list them here but there are so many memorable performances here! It would be unfair to highlight one, two or three! Good cops, bad cops, ugly rich, up-and-coming, downtrodden poor, the very honest and very crooked with all shades in between! Each and every role a character study in and of itself and together they make a living &quot;time capsule&quot; of the forties that we can revisit for generations to come.<br/><br/>And then there&#39;s that sound track which hooked me on great trumpet players and the Est Coast Jazz sound of the era. I just love that music and way it interweaves with the ongoing theme - it&#39;s perfectly united with the faithful and compelling use of the film-noir style.<br/><br/>I saw this movie first in Chicago and heck, back then I knew nothing about LA, though I&#39;ve since moved to and lived in the area for years. Once relocated, I quickly discovered the historically interesting side to the story and then appreciated the movie from yet another compelling angle. No question, the plot is fundamentally sound with many totally unexpected and yet quite plausible turns. But I later understood that it&#39;s within the realm of believability from factual standpoint, as well as intellectually/emotionally.<br/><br/>Geez, I&#39;ll never forget that first confrontational scene at the Albacore Club! The study in absolute raw and evil power as masterly portrayed by John Huston. In the very same scene Jack Nicholson skillfully paints the subtleties of his cautious, cynical, small-time hustler character. The air crackles! I must have played this scene in my mind a thousand times. When I visited Catalina Island for the first time in about 1985, not knowing its significance to the movie, I walked by the Albacore Club (The Tuna Club in real life) and froze transfixed. I recognized it instantly of course, and I must have stood there gawking for 20 minutes not saying a word. I could literally HEAR the Chinatown theme - the memories were that clear and fresh!<br/><br/>In closing, I guess then what does it about Chinatown for me (why I feel so strongly that it is the very best movie of all) is that every facet of the movie construction, from the opening scene to the ending credits, somehow fits together in a homogeneous, complete and absolutely flawless way. <br/><br/>I find it fascinating to analyze the characters and their makeup. To imagine the reasons they did what they did. But there is NOTHING I would change. Nothing.",

Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can&#39;t expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&amp;white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It&#39;s not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo&#39;s paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. <br/><br/>Raging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It&#39;s the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it&#39;s just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. <br/><br/>In Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn&#39;t like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn&#39;t care; &#39;cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. <br/><br/>At the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: &quot;A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!&quot;. There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",

Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious &quot;Rear Window&quot; which immediately followed it in his career.<br/><br/>However. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.<br/><br/>Yes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn&#39;t grown out of by &quot;Marnie&quot; some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it&#39;s well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.<br/><br/>Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who&#39;d want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it&#39;s pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade (since &quot;Saboteur&quot; in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.<br/><br/>About those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly&#39;s doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can&#39;t imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann&#39;s jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland&#39;s unexpected approach.<br/><br/>Yes, it&#39;s old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it&#39;s old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.",

                        "plaidHtml": "For some reason, I couldn&#39;t quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! <br/><br/>As far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase &quot;emotions are what makes us human&quot;! <br/><br/>I recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.<br/><br/>Certainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy&#39;s &quot;A-ha&quot; moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.<br/><br/>In terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind&#39;s performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.<br/><br/>Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan&#39;s well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",

                        "plaidHtml": "&quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot; opened here in France on Jan. 12th (as &quot;Le Château Ambulant,&quot; natch), and I saw it at an avant-première. As a raving fan of Miyazaki and of Diana Wynne Jones, I feel lucky to be an American living in France -- I see there&#39;s no release date announced yet for the U.S. Sorry, folks, and blame Disney! <br/><br/>I understand the feelings of viewers who have criticized the movie as trite. I find it&#39;s less imaginative, in terms of character development and emotional profundity, than Miyazaki&#39;s best masterpieces. However, even a pedestrian Miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich, frightening, imaginative and humane than any six Disney films put together, and there&#39;s a lot to love in &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle.&quot; <br/><br/>I am glad I didn&#39;t reread Jones&#39; book before seeing the film; even going on my six-year-old memory of the novel, I can see the movie&#39;s a very loose adaptation, and I think Jones fans would do best to try to take the movie on its own merits instead of looking for a faithful adaptation. That said, Miyazaki is surprisingly successful, at moments, in capturing the richness of the novel&#39;s characters: the peculiar co-habitation of charm and terror in Howl the sorcerer and his demon companion Calcifer, and the pragmatic strength of will that makes us love Sophie, the protagonist, who embodies both the fairy-tale archetypes of the young girl and the old woman at once.<br/><br/>Miyazaki&#39;s directorial trademarks are here in spades. Most of them lend strength and power to the film: his passion for open landscapes, his vision of the power and horror of war, the uncompromised way his movies work to empower children, and especially girls. A few of them are just Miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement (walrus mustaches, cobbled European squares, and flying machines for everyone!) Richer and stranger, though, are the very successful integration of two things that Disney animation never even approaches: the way even a children&#39;s story can blur lines between an enemy and a friend, and the cohabitation of the monstrous and the sublime. Enemy, ally, monster, beloved: Miyazaki gives both visual and moral weight to these disturbing contradictions, and certain scenes in &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot; evoke a frightening sublimity I have never seen elsewhere than in &quot;Princess Mononoke.&quot; <br/><br/>I think the film suffers from a slightly hurried pace, especially with respect to the protagonists&#39; character development, and the result is a loss of the subtlety that makes Jones&#39; book such a gripping fairy tale. Her Howl is more ambivalent, and her story is a more complex investigation of adolescent heartlessness and the growth of the heart. The ending, which falls back too much on clichéd imagery and deus-ex-machina, also could have been better handled. All that said, &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot; contains lots of treasures and will, I think, stand up to repeated viewings. Miyazaki fans will be delighted, and kids around the world should be given the chance to taste this latest rich, respectful children&#39;s tale. (Be warned, though: there are moments as terrifying as those in &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; and younger kids will need their parents with them.) <br/><br/>On a final note, as few hardcore fans of Japanese anime will need to be reminded, the movie is doubtless best seen in its original version with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is terrific -- although the voice of &quot;young Sophie&quot; doesn&#39;t strike me as anything special, the actors playing the aged Sophie, Howl, and especially Calcifer are fantastic. Calcifer is a magnificent creation and should delight even the most conservative fan of the novel. I have serious doubts that the inevitable English-language dub will do the nuances justice.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Saw &#39;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#39; on the promise of one of the year&#39;s best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh&#39;s previous work. <br/><br/>On the most part &#39;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#39; was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film&#39;s many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it. <br/><br/>Did have a couple of issues with &#39;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#39; myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one. <br/><br/>Epileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed). <br/><br/>Abbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn&#39;t have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred. <br/><br/>There are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon&#39;s actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.<br/><br/>However, there is so much to like about &#39;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#39;. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn&#39;t in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand&#39;s performance is a career high and one of the year&#39;s best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don&#39;t condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother&#39;s worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film&#39;s most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage&#39;s, although Dinklage doesn&#39;t have the film&#39;s most tragic scene). <br/><br/>Sam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it&#39;s the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him. <br/><br/>Another standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not &quot;likeable&quot; ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially). <br/><br/>A large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It&#39;s the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. &#39;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#39; has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does. <br/><br/>With the exception of one scene, &#39;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&#39; is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell&#39;s music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous &quot;Last Rose of Summer&quot; exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere. <br/><br/>Overall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year&#39;s best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

                        "plaidHtml": "An extremely competent look at the Scottish drug-Scene, Trainspotting is a perfect example of the potential of the UK industry to tell a story of tragedy, horror and hope in a manner that the American industry has yet to do without drifting into tired Cliche. While the manner and style of delivery are extremely funny and at times appear almost unreal, the fact remains that these characters are real. The clearly psychotic and alcoholic Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle is a supporting role that is actually of immense value to the film. Here we have character who I&#39;ve met, you&#39;ve met and we&#39;ve all met. A man with very little to lose absorbed in a sea of alcohol and prone to violence. I choose him as example because he isnt even involved in the drug-scene in which the main characters are central. In fact his opposition is somewhat humorous when we consider his own vices make him argueably worse off and the incidences of violence he becomes involved in<br/><br/>are most definitely black humour. Considering what is actually happening isnt funny, watching it play out, aside from one major incident, is extremely funny. And that is the tone of the film throughout, as characters continually talk nonsence and sail through the lives they have chosen, making very little progress, but instead drifting downwards until an opportunity presents itself to change their ways, where upon Renton, Ewan McGregor, must make a choice between his own life or his friends. McGregor himself is excellent in the film that made him, as is Jonny Lee Miller, who surprised me in this film by having a more thought-provoking character than the script and time strictly allowed considering his relatively minimal place in the main storyline. Ewen Bremner provided some excellent and often well-needed comic relief and Carlyle as I mentioned, was outstanding. This film is both real and unreal, taking the Humour of &quot;Human Traffic&quot; and the somber tone of &quot;My name is Joe&quot; and blending them together to create an unforgettable experience vividly accompanied by strains of &quot;Perfect day&quot; and other cultural and nostalgic sounds, particularly of the place and period. Trainspotting has been accused of glamourising drug-use but I firmly believe anyone who takes this view hasnt watched it properly. The fun is equally, if not more so, matched by some nasty images and for the time it was released, provided what was a very necessary look at the growing drug industry, the loss it creates and the hope that can arise. Superb.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,&#39; director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.  <br/><br/>\tAs an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short. Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it&#39;s the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it&#39;s an obligation, and failure is not an option. If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code. Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito&#39;s demands.<br/><br/>\tMeanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he&#39;s home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he&#39;ll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks. But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to `loan&#39; Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission. So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.  <br/><br/>\tFrom the beginning of the film to it&#39;s spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.<br/><br/>\tAlec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.  It&#39;s a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden&#39;s work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.<br/><br/>\tOther notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.<br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green). Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, `The Bridge On the River Kwai&#39; is one of David Lean&#39;s masterpieces.  It&#39;s an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

                        "plaidHtml": "If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood&#39;s Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood&#39;s long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.<br/><br/>You know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can&#39;t bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood&#39;s direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.<br/><br/>Following the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt&#39;s less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to &#39;keep an eye on him&#39;, but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family&#39;s youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt&#39;s prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.<br/><br/>All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt&#39;s life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.<br/><br/>With a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.",

Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.<br/><br/>The premise is nice and simple, which works brilliantly because the plot is established as a foundation without hindering the experience of the movie itself. The viewer is allowed unrestricted access and exploration of the messages offered by the film.<br/><br/>In addition, Totoro is not bound by any rules of traditional storytelling. Instead, it presents occurrences that touch on a fundamental human level that is so deep and profound that it will have you feeling a range of emotions. There are so many layers to this movie, each one meaningful and special. From community building to the love of a family to sibling relationships to facing the unknown; everyone can take away something personal from this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most sacred aspect of the film, however, is that it reminds us that life is magical. Not all of us have a neighbor like Totoro, but we are all fortunate in different ways. Each of us has something to treasure, something that brings joy and comfort.<br/><br/>Totoro is special in that it frees the viewer to be a child again and to contemplate the world through a perspective that we have perhaps forgotten. Everything is new and interesting and beautiful, from a crumbling porch to an acorn seed. We live in a magical world, and it is definitely worth taking the time to appreciate this.",

I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through &quot;Pale Rider&quot; a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn&#39;t lie to them, doesn&#39;t kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even &quot;Boys don&#39;t Cry&quot; could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That&#39;s a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn&#39;t end there however...<br/><br/>This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali&#39;s face, and Zahra&#39;s tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.<br/><br/>We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali&#39;s Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.<br/><br/>There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.<br/><br/>Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.<br/><br/>The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.<br/><br/>Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.<br/><br/>I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ollie",

                        "plaidHtml": "This is simply Scott&#39;s finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven&#39;t quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.<br/><br/>This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night.",

                        "plaidHtml": "The Gold Rush is pure gold.  It was Charlie Chaplin&#39;s third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.  <br/><br/>This movie should be counted among Chaplin&#39;s best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I&#39;ve also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy&#39;s immortal geniuses.<br/><br/>Having first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college&#39;s silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. <br/><br/>\nEven so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven&#39;t even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that&#39;s also on the disc.<br/><br/>The viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard.  On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!<br/><br/>Also, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD.  But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.<br/><br/>The first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I&#39;ve ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies.  <br/><br/>And the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they&#39;ve seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t say this to sound pretentious.  I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted.  It&#39;s hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years.  <br/><br/>For example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin&#39;s first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama.  In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema&#39;s potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously.  Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.<br/><br/>The joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy.  This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle&#39;s aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp&#39;s grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.<br/><br/>One pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing.  <br/><br/>When Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm.  This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD.  <br/><br/>The second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn&#39;t sustain the entire film at the cabin.  Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film&#39;s third act. <br/><br/>\nI don&#39;t want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.<br/><br/>Mack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat.  Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid.  From what I&#39;ve seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. <br/><br/>\nThe Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today&#39;s more sophisticated stories and special effects.  The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia&#39;s true feelings for the Tramp.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that&#39;s a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.  What a shame.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)",

The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It&#39;s more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven&#39;t seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you&#39;ll be confused to death. Obvious isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.<br/><br/>The series doesn&#39;t only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It&#39;s a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince&#39;s Tale scene.<br/><br/>No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.<br/><br/>For me it&#39;s really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I&#39;m not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you&#39;re a fan or not, you&#39;ll love this series.

                        "plaidHtml": "Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater&#39;s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it&#39;s glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that&#39;s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental &#39;Hollywood romance&#39;, which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...<br/><br/>Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it&#39;s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they&#39;re the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they&#39;re watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it&#39;s own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I&#39;m not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don&#39;t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.<br/><br/>In a film like this, it is the writing that&#39;s the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that&#39;s the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn&#39;t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.<br/><br/>Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.",

The costumes were also incredible. The actors portrayed the best purest form of both ancient Roman and old Judean culture. This film also had quite an emotional effect. The way that Christ&#39;s face is never visible nor his voice audible to the audience creates a feeling of reverence to the actual person of Jesus. Lew Wallace also did an amazing job portraying the innocence, kindness, and mercy of Jesus, and his effect on the main character, Judah Ben Hur. Hur&#39;s ending quote, &quot;I felt him take the sword out of my hand&quot; was a wonderful picture of his changing. I admit, I am a Christian, but even for those who are not this is still a great film. The message boards confirm that. I recognize that there are some people that require constant action to keep their attention. If this is your case, than this movie is not for you, as it has a lot of dialogue. But I recommend this movie 100%.",

His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson&#39;s film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. <br/><br/>Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave&#39;s company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he&#39;s blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.<br/><br/>I frankly don&#39;t understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren&#39;t familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. <br/><br/>Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities. You won&#39;t want to return to the real world when the credits start to roll.",

Cobb), the arrogant mob boss <br/><br/>Friendly takes affectionate interest in Terry and tries to make things easy for him He also takes advantage of Terry by involving him in the killing of an uncooperative docker Unaware of their murderous intentions, Terry sets the trap for the man who is thrown from a roof top because he allowed himself to be interviewed by a crime investigating commission<br/><br/>Terry&#39;s alienation from the crooked union leaders starts when he meets the dead man&#39;s sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint), and realizes the grief he has brought into her life She asks his help in bringing the racketeers to justice, as does Father Barry (Karl Malden), a priest of complete goodness and rightness <br/><br/>Brando&#39;s moral dilemma was superbly drawn in the film He&#39;s an ordinary man finding the courage to stand up and be counted As portrayed by Brando he is touchingly believable <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is excellent:<br/><br/>Cobb is extremely good as the brute fury boss who intimidates the workers into silence, stopping at nothing to maintain his position of power on the docks... <br/><br/>Rod Steiger gives his finest performance as the clever and suave opportunistic lawyer who works for the local docker&#39;s union...<br/><br/>Eva Marie Saint manages to make the blood go through Brando&#39;s valves reviving and creating a heart that never existed before... <br/><br/>Karl Malden is hard and clear as the activist Catholic priest who continue encouraging other longshoremen to testify, inciting Brando to fight for his rightsregardless of the costrather than be a pawn in a ruthless system of bribes and killings... <br/><br/>&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; is one of the great American films, not only because it bravely spreads a strong light on the violation of justice, but because it is a powerful piece of cinema, which push forward a classic study of man&#39;s responsibility to his fellow man... <br/><br/>The film won eight Academy Awards...",

Bergman&#39;s autobiographical story also benefits from the brilliant casting of Swedish film legend Victor Sjostrom as Isak Borg, whose towering performance is essential to the success of Wild Strawberries.  I read that Bergman based the coffin dream sequence on a frequent nightmare that he had -- and it never ceases to amaze me just how effective it remains even after all these years.  Wild Strawberries seems like a quiet, thoughtful, introsepective movie -- and it is; it is also one of world cinema&#39;s most impressive motion pictures.",

It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching.  As an extra bonus, it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era, with many realistic details, inspired by a historical incident.<br/><br/>After a short opening sequence, the movie divides nicely into two halves. Johnny (Keaton) is a railway engineer, turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl.  Continuing with the railroad, one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies, who also kidnap his girl.  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it, and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home.  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun, with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in.  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touches.<br/><br/>Keaton is at his best, with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents.  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein, and his character&#39;s stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic action.<br/><br/>This belongs near the top of any list of great films, a classic worth watching and re-watching.",

For a film like this to be made during the free wheeling seventies had to take some big stones. One must admire Mr. Kubrick for even trying to produce and direct such a complex and expensive film that had all the ear markings of a financial and personal disaster. Not only did Kubrick manage to out do his last epic &quot;2001&quot; but he has created a movie that not only showcases the untapped acting abilities of Ryan O&#39;Neil, but a beautifully lensed film that uses minimal lighting , gorgeous sets, perfect balance, positioning and meticulous timing. I have never seen such a magnificent film such as this one. Every shot and frame plays out like an eighteenth century oil painting.<br/><br/>A young Irish man of lower class has the strangest quirk of luck. After participating in an illegal duel, young Barry is forced to flee from his home village. After being accosted by some gentlemanly highway robbers, Barry winds up cross country and becomes a conscripted soldier. Rising in rank, Barry is sent to fight in the Seven&#39;s Year War. Whilst in battle he watches his friends and fellow soldiers being slaughtered in combat due to poor tactics and leadership. Having enough of this life of hardship and struggle, Barry uses his god given talents to do what he has to do in order to survive and become a man of proper social standing.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this movie. I&#39;ve put off watching this film until recently. Some have told me how long and boring this movie was. Others have said it was pretty self serving and not worth watching. But after seeing part of it on T.C.M., I just had to find a copy of my own. The film is over three hours in length but they go by very quickly because Barry&#39;s story is so captivating. Kubrick poured his heart and soul into this film. The results are on the screen. He&#39;s clearly a master film maker. His reputation is cemented forever with this movie. Ryan O&#39;Neil impressed the hell out me with his role as Barry Lyndon. He gives the character some dignity and depth that no other actor could have possibly given to the title role.<br/><br/>Overall I would have to give this film one of my highest recommendations. This is one of my top ten films of all time. If people tell you not to watch this masterpiece ignore them. I advise you to get a copy and enjoy. For a film like this you need to set aside a weekend afternoon to fully appreciate a film such as this. Believe me you will not regret it.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation possible.<br/><br/>It doesn&#39;t matter whether you watch it on D.V.D. or V.C.D. because the transfers are excellent on either format.",

Belfast guy Gerry Conlon is suspected of being one of the IRA terrorists responsible for a bomb in Guilford, London, in 1974, which killed several people. He spends 15 years in jail, fighting for his innocence and for truth.<br/><br/>After working with Daniel Day Lewis in &quot;My left foot&quot;, director Jim Sheridan teams again with the actor for this drama. The strong cast is completed by Emma Thomson and Pete Postlewaite. The result is a brilliant, passionate feature which tells about injustice. It&#39;s a disquieting film.<br/><br/>This is doubtless the most achieved collaboration between the director and the main star. The other pictures as well are very good, but here we have a film of accusation -the story is more involving. Day Lewis performance in &quot;My left foot&quot; was awarded with an Oscar, but the actor could have been given the same prize for his play of Gerry Conlon.<br/><br/>Strong screenplay, actors and soundtrack -with music of Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer and songs of Irish stars Bono and Sinead O&#39;Connor.",

                        "plaidHtml": "I can identify a lot with The Deer Hunter because my mother&#39;s family were of Ukranian background and my relatives on her side were a whole lot like the people we see here from Clairton, Pennsylvania. They worked in the same factory jobs that these men do and answered the call of their country at war, but in a whole different time. And the grandson of one my uncles recently served in Iraq as a marine.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, these people for all their personal faults are the backbone of America. They are the folks whose blood gets spilled in the wars we fight. So when they are called it had better not be in an unrighteous or fruitless cause.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage are three mill workers from small town Clairton, Pennsylvania. All from Slavic background as my family is and in a time when those of us more educated and more sophisticated and knowing better dodge the draft, these guys enlist and go to Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is about the effects of that war on all of them and all around them.<br/><br/>John Savage gets overlooked a lot with both Robert DeNiro being nominated for Best Actor and Christopher Walken winning for Best Supporting Actor, but Savage is the guy most physically damaged, losing a leg as a result of the escape all three make from a Viet Cong prison. He&#39;s growing quite accustomed to what he calls the country club of the VA hospital he&#39;s in and can&#39;t bring himself to come home.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is a hunter on weekends, as were some in my family. But the sure marksman from before Vietnam, after having to kill people to stay alive, is not about killing defenseless deer any longer. Meryl Streep plays the woman who loves both DeNiro and Walken and she&#39;s so totally immersed in her role and her role&#39;s ethnic background, I could swear she was one of my relatives.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken will blow you away with his performance of the man totally unhinged by his capture with the Viet Cong and the Russian Roulette games they play with the captives. His final confrontation with DeNiro will move you beyond words.<br/><br/>Michael Cimino who directed and co-wrote the screenplay got an Oscar for the film and himself and deserved every bit of it. Acclaimed the new genius of the cinema, his next project proved to be an overblown disaster, Heaven&#39;s Gate. Not that that film was as bad as it was made out to be, but Cimino&#39;s career plummeted and never really got back on track.<br/><br/>28 years later I remember the Oscar ceremonies in 1979 when a dying John Wayne presented the Best Picture Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Ironic also because one of the cast member, John Cazale who played one of the friends in Clairton and best remembered for being Freddo Corleone in The Godfather also was dying of cancer while the film was being shot.<br/><br/>Although I find it a bit too coincidental that three men from the same small town who join the Army would have the exact same service record, The Deer Hunter isn&#39;t really about the Vietnam War. It&#39;s about war and what it can do those that serve and to those around them.<br/><br/>And this review is dedicated to those that serve.",

                        "plaidHtml": "I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I. <br/><br/>Like our protagonist Desmond Doss here, York had a rural background and joined a pacifist religious sect. Unlike Doss, York grew up as a hunter and was a dead shot. He wasn&#39;t sure what he would do if a combat situation arose. But he did what he did and got every decoration imaginable including the Congressional Medal Of Honor.<br/><br/>Doss had a tougher row to hoe. He would not touch a weapon and the film will show you why. He felt it his patriotic duty to join, but as a combat medic, save lives rather than kill. With no weapon to defend his own person, this medic saved a lot of people at an engagement at a place dubbed Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa.<br/><br/>In Sergeant York, Walter Brennan&#39;s country preacher character says that Gary Cooper has the &#39;using kind of religion&#39;. That might well be said of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss who got a Best Actor Oscar nomination as Doss. Cooper won one of his two Oscars for Sergeant York and Garfield really suggests his character in what he does with Doss.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are suggestive of Saving Private Ryan, director Mel Gibson staged them well. Hacksaw Ridge did win a pair of Oscars for its Sound. Gibson got nominated for Best Director and the film itself for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Hacksaw Ridge shows the horrors of war and from it the beauty of heroism when people have to summon their personal best and become more than themselves. The Doss story is one that deserves telling and retelling. Thanks to Mel Gibson it will be permanently retold.",

The whiff of corruption in occupied post-war Vienna? the cuckoo-clock speech atop the big wheel? even Anton Karras&#39; zither? Perhaps ALL these things? If however, you had to nominate just a single influence within the whole production that elevates it to greatness I suggest that would be Robert Krasker&#39;s cinematography. <br/><br/>The finished product innovatively, was years ahead of its birthright. Time and time again the viewer is bailed up by stunning camera angles and back-lighting. The eerie shadows around the deserted streets and of course the unforgettable first glimpse of Harry Lime (Welles) himself as he skulks like the rat he is, in the corner of the building, lit in close-up suddenly from the light in an adjacent apartment. Offhand I cannot think of a character&#39;s more dramatic entrance to a film.<br/><br/>Welles in fact has minimal screen time, though his dark presence and influence infiltrate proceedings like an insidious disease. Yet somehow his ultimate demise in the sewers brings into play an incredible sadness and compassion that has absolutely no right being there. It remains for me one of my top five film favorites. I have always given it a &quot;10&quot; personally but hey, to be voted an &quot;8.6&quot; universally is a pretty fair vindication of my words here.",

It puts a lot of detail-work in the creation of the characters, and once you think that is over and the &quot;regular action-part&quot; starts, it becomes even better and the story takes a 90 degree turn! After I had finished watching the entire movie, I needed at least 5 minutes just to &quot;digest&quot; it and rethink this fantastic film. If you got a chance to watch it, don&#39;t miss it!

Memories of Murder isn&#39;t a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.<br/><br/>Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",

Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.<br/><br/>Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can&#39;t highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don&#39;t understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won&#39;t even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!<br/><br/>RATING: [4/5]",

I would hate to be the kind of movie fan who never watches silent or black and white movies (you&#39;d be surprised how many there are). So if you are like that do yourself a favour, get hold of a copy of this movie and enjoy, it shocks me that films such as &#39;Something about Mary&#39; are rated higher than this masterpiece of comedy, there is nothing wrong with &#39;SaM&#39; even I laughed at it, but, watching it once was enough, however I watch Sherlock jr again and again in pure amazement at Buster Keaton and his cameraman, Elgin Lessley&#39;s achievements without the aid of modern technology, like most other&#39;s the scene where he dives through a window to reappear as a little old lady gobsmacks me, how did he do it? Keaton can only be described in one word, genius. I have to add that I have the Kino version on DVD with the appalling soundtrack, but, luckily I also have it with a more appropriate soundtrack, which is far superior and adds extra enjoyment to an already fabulous movie.",

In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think &#39;John Wick: Chapter 4&#39; is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.<br/><br/>A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn&#39;t all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.<br/><br/>As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn&#39;t matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he&#39;ll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It&#39;s best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.<br/><br/>Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsgård. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.<br/><br/>This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.",

                        "plaidHtml": "MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I&#39;ve watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it&#39;s a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.<br/><br/>I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there&#39;s little else to get in the way. It&#39;s one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that&#39;s never been done before.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that&#39;s not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it&#39;s pretty much my idea of a perfect film.",

Mary has absolutely no friends and is teased by her schoolmate Benny Clifford. She has a complex because of her brown birthmark in the forehead and she adores her favorite cartoon The Noblets that she watches with her rooster Ethel and condensed milk. Meanwhile, in New York, the lonely forty-four year-old Max Jerry Horowitz has Asperge Syndrome and trouble to sleep and is obese since he eats chocolate hot-dogs to compensate his anxiety. He frequently goes to the Overeaters Anonymous Meeting. Max does not have any friend, only the invisible Mr. Ravioli, and also loves The Noblets. His life goals are to have a friend, Noblets and chocolate. One day, Mary picks Max address out of an American phone-book and she decides to write to him to ask from where babies come in America. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship oscillates due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.<br/><br/>&quot;Mary and Max&quot; is an unforgettable and heartbreaking bleak tale of friendship and loneliness. The story is bittersweet and witty, with an ironic black humor and provokes the most conflictive emotions in the viewers, funny in a moment, and depressive in the other. The excellent animation follows the dark style of Tim Burton and the screenplay is a profound insight in human behavior. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): &quot;Mary and Max – Uma Amizade Diferente&quot; (&quot;Mary and Max – A Different Friendship&quot;)",

A knight and his squire have returned to their country after a ten-year crusade. Deadly disease ravaged country. Knight faces Death. He calls Death on the multi-day game of chess...<br/><br/>The story has touched serious philosophical and religious topics. However, the story is full of intrigue, dark humor and hope. The protagonists are distracted between the vicious disease, self-pity and torture. It is interesting to see a deeply disillusioned knight, a cynical squire who hates women, a cheating wife, evil priests, a mute girl and seemingly healthy and happy family on the same road. The truth is all around them. The main protagonist used to persistently ask questions to which only he has a valid response. This film reveals some controversial issues. Is deadly disease greater threat to man or the man is the greatest enemy to himself? Mr. Bergman has painted realistic effects of fear, horror, cynicism, surprises, love and health on human faces.<br/><br/>Max von Sydow as Antonius Block, the knight is a more serious version of Don Quixote. Gunnar Björnstrand Jöns, the squire is a character who never changes his mood. He always has some sort of cynical jokes or words of contempt for each occurrence. Bengt Ekerot is Death in the true sense of that word. Nils Poppe as Jof is a juggler who has strange predictions. Fortunately, no one believes him. Bibi Andersson as Mia, Jof&#39;s wife is a beautiful and cheerful woman who does not fit into the landscape.<br/><br/>Life is a hard journey. The rare moments of happiness are a sort of salvation. The end of the film emphasizes the transience of life and the power of death which no one can escape. Of course, only in the eyes of one of the protagonists.",

On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It&#39;s not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams&#39; performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it&#39;s hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It&#39;s almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he&#39;s most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin&#39;s death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly &quot;moved&quot; in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won&#39;t be sorry.",

It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; is entertainment at its bests.<br/><br/>The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.<br/><br/>There is some great dialog but the true power of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!<br/><br/>Pure entertainment for the entire family!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

But its also about hope &amp; fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed &amp; often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son &amp; mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.<br/><br/>&#39;Room&#39; is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful &amp; the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson&#39;s Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Brie Larson &amp; Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders &amp; makes &#39;Room&#39; unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen &amp; The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.<br/><br/>On the whole, &#39;Room&#39; is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable.",

                        "plaidHtml": "My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw &#39;The Big Lebowski&#39; on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight &quot;fun&quot; movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. &#39;The Big Lewboski&#39; is an extremely smart film, but it doesn&#39;t shout &quot;look at me! Aren&#39;t I clever?&quot;. It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that&#39;s what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges (&#39;Fat City&#39;, &#39;Starman&#39;) IS The Dude, and it&#39;s impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore (&#39;Boogie Nights&#39;), David Huddleston (&#39;Capricorn One&#39;), Philip Seymour Hoffman (&#39;Magnolia&#39;) and Sam Elliot (&#39;Mask&#39;), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara (&#39;The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie&#39;) and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can&#39;t fault &#39;The Big Lebowski&#39;, it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It&#39;s movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office Top Ten was as inspired and amusing as this one!",

                        "plaidHtml": "I can vividly remember the first time i saw this movie - it was during a festival of Japanese movies in an art house cinema here in Dublin. I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before, i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don&#39;t want anyone to know, and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing, I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly, without the usual post movie chatter - and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never, ever witnessed that in a cinema.<br/><br/>Since then, i&#39;ve watched it on DVD, and had to think a lot about why such a simple movie is so powerful, and so many people rate it as one of the greatest ever. And why i find myself agreeing with that rating, i truly think it is in the top 10 ever made - certainly the top 5 of any I&#39;ve seen. But its hard at first to know why. It doesn&#39;t have the greatest script of any movie, there are few things in it that are truly original. The acting is great, but not the greatest ever seen, and the technical qualities are just average. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the reason for its greatness is that it comes closest to pure art in cinema. By pure art, i mean art that in its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives. When i think about Tokyo Story I don&#39;t find myself comparing it to other movies, instead I think of a Rembrandt self portrait, a Vermeer painting, or my favourite short story, &#39;The Dead&#39; by James Joyce. It is simple, unadorned, and deeply wise. I realise in writing this I&#39;m rapidly approaching pseuds corner, but this is my genuine conclusion (writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated in most of the arts).<br/><br/>Of course there have been many great movies about families, about growing old, about the nature of life.... but I think somehow Ozu achieved a sort of perfection with Tokyo Story. Thats why its the only movie I would give a &#39;10&#39; to.",

                        "plaidHtml": "I&#39;ve never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;. Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver&#39;s seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.<br/><br/>One of the main strengths of &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot; is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of &quot;big corporation screwing over the little guy&quot; thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.<br/><br/>The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles&#39; wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.<br/><br/>There&#39;s also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;. It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn&#39;t a comedy. It&#39;s long, but doesn&#39;t feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present.",

Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer&#39;s gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti&#39;s mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne&#39;s native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr&#39;s reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to &#39;La Passion de Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39; and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti&#39;s Jeanne.",

This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone&#39;s own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, &#39;Raging Bull&#39;, and &#39;Rocky&#39; will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it&#39;s quite an achievement.<br/><br/>The story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).<br/><br/>&#39;Rocky&#39; is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like &#39;Over the Top&#39;, &#39;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&#39; and &#39;Judge Dredd&#39;, and from the other &#39;Rocky&#39;-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone&#39;s screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, &#39;Raging Bull&#39; stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.<br/><br/>I do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four &#39;Rocky&#39;-films fail and where films like this one and &#39;Raging Bull&#39; and Clint Eastwood&#39;s &#39;Million Dollar Baby&#39; succeed.",

                        "plaidHtml": "This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O&#39;Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today&#39;s youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don&#39;t have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. &quot;Ratatouille&quot; is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! &quot;Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!&quot;",

                        "plaidHtml": "Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone&#39;s Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>Those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what&#39;s left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. <br/><br/>In Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier who, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man&#39;s highest value... life.<br/><br/>Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. They both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn&#39;t take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the &quot;enemy&quot; does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all it&#39;s an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.<br/><br/>The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man&#39;s wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man&#39;s young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. <br/><br/>Elias doesn&#39;t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.<br/><br/>Platoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a film that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a damn to watch. There isn&#39;t any War film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam War as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.<br/><br/>The best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam from the 80&#39;s, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death to see. I also don&#39;t watch this film for an action ; I actually see it for the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.<br/><br/>The battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the &#39;spotlight&#39; on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These &#39;men of God&#39; preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. &#39;Spotlight&#39;s&#39; dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.<br/><br/>Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn&#39;t afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For &#39;Spotlight&#39; to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.<br/><br/>The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, &#39;Spotlight&#39; pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, &#39;Spotlight&#39; refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American&#39;s. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real &#39;cherry&#39; in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes &#39;Spotlight&#39; to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.<br/><br/>This is the best journalistic drama since 1976&#39;s &#39;All the President&#39;s Men&#39;. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe&#39;s newsroom as it should have been. &#39;Spotlight&#39; doesn&#39;t shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and &#39;Spotlight&#39; has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy.",

Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it&#39;s an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it&#39;s about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.  That&#39;s a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.<br/><br/>In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can&#39;t balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to &quot;get on your feet, soldier.&quot;  She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous.  And it&#39;s not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she&#39;s grown up.<br/><br/>It&#39;s relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me.  It&#39;s gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart.  It&#39;s quickly developing love story touches me.  Its humor makes the dark places in me smile.  But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah&#39;s precipitous transformation.

                        "plaidHtml": "Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you&#39;re a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there&#39;s that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.<br/><br/>Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They&#39;ve obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid&#39;s body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it&#39;s a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it&#39;s the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.<br/><br/>These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can&#39;t get any love or respect from his father and it&#39;s obvious that he gets it from his friends. That&#39;s what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy&#39;s best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he&#39;s the kid who you knew in school and just knew he&#39;d turn out bad, but there&#39;s a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who&#39;s been disappointed so many times by an adult.<br/><br/>Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there&#39;s Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other&#39;s appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.<br/><br/>The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That&#39;s what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.<br/><br/>10/10",

You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it&#39;s really unbelievable.<br/><br/>It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Brühl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.<br/><br/>A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced.

It&#39;s obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.<br/><br/>It couldn&#39;t be more related to today. Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become, but it stays on the air because people don&#39;t want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then, but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can&#39;t even tell they&#39;re acting. It feels like you&#39;re watching these people in their daily lives, interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time. I could write 20 more pages about it&#39;s brilliance, but I&#39;ll stop now to keep me from rating. I just have to say that it&#39;s so rare to find a film as incredibly flawless as this.",

It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked &#39;Before Sunrise&#39; as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says &quot;nothing that is complete breathes&quot;, and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.<br/><br/>The dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end. Kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend. If you are an action movie kind of person, skip this flick because it will bore you to tears. If, on the other hand, you like good dialogue, well formed characters, and aren&#39;t quite jaded enough to have given up completely on the idea of true love, don&#39;t miss this film.",

The sets were so imaginative and well done, from poppy fields to enchanted woods to yellow brick road. <br/><br/>For once, MGM&#39;s habit of over-producing what&#39;s on screen really paid off with an appropriately lavish scale. The effects are simply breathtaking, but I can also detect the nightmarish visuals that go beyond the demonic Witch of the West. So I can see why kids would be both mesmerized and unsettled by the fantastic adventures.<br/><br/>I also have to say that Garland was wonderful as Dorothy, though I&#39;ve never been a particular fan. Plus, her captivating rendition of Rainbow deserves to top the all-time movie charts. All in all, I&#39;m sorry it took me so long to catch up. It&#39;s really hard to believe that so many cooks (writers &amp; directors) didn&#39;t spoil the outcome. Somehow, the sumptuous production with its sturdy moral all came together, and remains aptly a movie for the ages.",

Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It&#39;s what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it&#39;s excellent entertainment.<br/><br/>The visuals and sound are very impressive, but it&#39;s the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.<br/><br/>As an adult, it&#39;s not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented. There are wonderful colors in here, too, and a good 5.1 surround system with a sub-woofer would probably blow the roof off!",

                        "plaidHtml": "La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..<br/><br/>This film is powerful and grim. Totally unforgettable is the last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away. It comes very suddenly and there are no warnings what will happen at the end of this film. The message is so important and these marks of the &quot;apocalypse&quot; can be found in our everyday life everywhere. The society is falling and it is &quot;spinning&quot; as the voice over says just before the end credits..The film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago, but no. Racism is such a primitive, stupid and despisable cancer among people, that there is no hope of better future if individuals don&#39;t understand the real facts of life and right ways to live with each other. Hate feeds hate as the character Hubert says, and that is something that our stupid race has not learned.<br/><br/>There is one very powerful scene just before the end scene and it deals with a skinhead and these three characters who could kill him right away and pay something back. It is very challenging scene and even Vinz, the most revenge seeking character, starts to see things different way after that. The whole point of La Haine is violence in all its forms. Why there is violence and why the hell it is used so often everywhere in every form? Don&#39;t we ever learn? These kind of films are important and so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them don&#39;t want to or they can&#39;t bacause it would be as a mirror for them..<br/><br/>The film is also a comment on power used by police as they are pretty tough and hard in this film. Police think that they can use any methods in order to get some answers, or in order to have some fun..It certainly doesn&#39;t judge police as &quot;pigs&quot; or violent sadists in general, but it is a warning example of what must NOT happen anywhere ever, by police or by others. One has to see through the film and to its core in order to understand what it says. Otherwise there is no point in watching these kind of films. La Haine is that kind of a film that it should be seen by police and youths as well, because there are still possibilities to prevent things to go too far in our life and world we live in.<br/><br/>The camera techniques used in this film are magnificent. Director/screenwriter Mathieu Kassovitz uses camera so smoothly and passionately and there are many similarities in techniques between this film and his more recent, Assassin(s). I am very happy for this young talent to have won the director&#39;s award at Cannes. These kind of talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid and worthless films which don&#39;t have nothing artistic in them and have nothing to say, and are just mindless and greedy entertainment. The black and white is very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel.<br/><br/>\nA great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.<br/><br/>10/10",

                        "plaidHtml": "Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney&#39;s first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.<br/><br/>Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character&#39;s personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of &#39;Pirates&#39; reads like a Who&#39;s Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.<br/><br/>When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early &#39;90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (E.T., Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Back to the Future to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.<br/><br/>I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt&#39;s performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner&#39;s in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, &#39;Pirates&#39; is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy &#39;Pirates&#39;.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom&#39;s performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.<br/><br/>Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor&#39;s daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you&#39;re a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that&#39;s about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.<br/><br/>A few predictions may be in order, however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp&#39;s efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound, set design, makeup, and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)? Not likely.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski, who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs, does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director, given his limited experience. True, &#39;Pirates&#39; has countless errors in continuity, but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name: a short entitled The Ritual (1996), and then three very different but effectively made films, Mouse Hunt (1997), The Mexican (2001), and the very creepy thriller The Ring (2002). Again, it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a $125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well, it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson, and it worked here for Disney as well.<br/><br/>&#39;Pirates of the Caribbean&#39; is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twenty-five. I enjoyed it immensely for exactly what it was... an amusing ride.",

So much of Steinbeck&#39;s beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it&#39;s hard to see his story and characters wedged into the &quot;gee whizz&quot; style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn&#39;t have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.<br/><br/>Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn&#39;t able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn&#39;t that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Grade: A",

The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was a pompous disclaimer that &quot;not one foot&quot; of documentary footage had been used. But, in light of the finished product, it&#39;s a remarkable statement. If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to its credit that one never gets a sense of &quot;good guys vs. bad guys&quot; here--only of people trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which no escape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the &quot;heroic&quot; Algerian revolutionaries while booing the &quot;villainous&quot; French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint. This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, and beautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven&#39;t seen it and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--and pray that it&#39;s subtitled and not dubbed. (There are dubbed prints and, as is usually the case, dubbing pretty nearly wrecks it.) This is a masterpiece.",

This was Ray&#39;s first movie, but his economy of dialog, his synchronization and sympathy with India&#39;s rural life is incredible. So little said, yet so much! Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a &quot;kash&quot; field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter? No. His expression and technique was more than sound, although this was a maiden venture. <br/><br/>Some critics found(and still find, I might add) the film to be too slow. Satyajit Ray wrote about the slow pace - &quot;The cinematic material dictated a style to me, a very slow rhythm determined by nature, the landscape, the country. The script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble.&quot;<br/><br/>There you are, if you have not watched this movie, you&#39;ll probably missed the greatest movie made on Indian rural life. That&#39;s why Akira Kurosawa said of him:&quot;To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun&quot;",

Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`s it. What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you. Yourè seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle, paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amores perros, and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surprise you",

                        "plaidHtml": "This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely my favorite classic. There are some that come close, such as Citizen Kane, Spellbound, and Psycho, but none quite compare to this amazing movie.<br/><br/>The first thing that you notice is the outstanding cinematography. You have to remember that this movie was made in 1940, when they didn&#39;t have the technology we have now. But that first shot of the water beating up against the rocks grabs you and for one split second you wonder if maybe this isn&#39;t part of the movie but rather something filmed just recently. But then you see the familiar face of Laurence Olivier, reminding you that this was made 60 years ago, a fact that forever amazes me. The only oscar it won besides Best Picture was well deserved.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes it such a wonderful film is the acting. I have debated on whether Laurence Olivier&#39;s character, the tortured Maxim de Winter, is the pitiable character or if his second wife played by Joan Fontaine is really the one to feel sorry for. Every time I watch it I see it from a different point of view. Joan Fontaine is excellent. Laurence Olivier is wonderful, but that&#39;s no surprise. The only thing that bugs me is that it seems in every movie he&#39;s in (well, at least, everything I&#39;ve seen him in), he always plays the same type of character.  But he&#39;s extremely good at it, so I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/><br/>But although Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are wonderful, Judith Anderson steals the show! The first time I watched the movie, I was immediately grabbed by her stunning performance as the sinister Mrs. Danvers. You hardly notice the other characters when she&#39;s in the scene. She acted the part so well that it&#39;s strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.<br/><br/>With a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock&#39;s films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest",

                        "plaidHtml": "Sex. One of the most overused element in cinema and often mis-used and unnecessary. I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. <br/><br/>This movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.<br/><br/>Thematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.<br/><br/>The story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.<br/><br/>The music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.<br/><br/>It isn&#39;t a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.",

And so modern. The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven&#39;t seen in an American film released prior to this one. <br/><br/>And yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the &quot;New Hollywood&quot; somehow &#39;Cool Hand Luke&#39; is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after &#39;Bonnie and Clyde&#39; in 1967 and before &#39;The Graduate&#39;. <br/><br/>I look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn&#39;t aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. <br/><br/>Funny, tragic and moving, &#39;Cool Hand Luke&#39; is one hell of a film.

                        "plaidHtml": "In his autobiography, The Name&#39;s Above the Title, Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters, the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.<br/><br/>What Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined. Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself, especially with that system all her own. But in doing what he did for Clark Gable&#39;s character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold.<br/><br/>Capra&#39;s autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it. <br/><br/>Capra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn&#39;t have been more cooperative.<br/><br/>At some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.<br/><br/>The rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.<br/><br/>The film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They&#39;re together for most of the film so if it doesn&#39;t click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in. <br/><br/>Gable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can&#39;t get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It&#39;s also a great film, but it&#39;s not a classic like It Happened One Night.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carné&#39;s Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.<br/><br/>Technically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine&#39;s friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.<br/><br/>However, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine&#39;s arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother&#39;s mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.<br/><br/>The main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir  looked at it, in fact is closer to L&#39;Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir&#39;s La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cinéma d&#39;auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut&#39;s life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.<br/><br/>The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine&#39;s life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend&#39;s idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).<br/><br/>The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: &#39;My mom died!&#39;<br/><br/>The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.<br/><br/>The prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on &#39;normal&#39; life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine&#39;s object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine&#39;s run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.",

                        "plaidHtml": "Ingmar Bergman&#39;s &#39;Persona (1966)&#39; opens with a bewildering montage of sounds and images, a frenzied newsreel of sex, death, cinema and comedy. The sequence is so far removed from my previous experience with the director that its effect is jarring, shocking; I momentarily wondered if I&#39;d hit a wrong button and started playing Buñuel&#39;s &#39;Un chien andalou (1929)&#39; by mistake. I question Bergman&#39;s motives for including such an uncharacteristic opening, for it appears to have very little to do with the narrative that follows. Is this montage - an account of the sickening and concealed horrors and desires of society - a possible explanation for Elisabeth&#39;s continued silence? Even so, it all seems somewhat exploitative, as though Bergman was simply going for shock-value, obliterating any notions of subtlety with which I had begun to associate him {though I&#39;ll admit that the strength of &#39;The Seventh Seal (1957)&#39; arose from its not-so-subtle representation of Death}. The opening scene concludes with a young boy awakening in the morgue, his hand outstretched towards the vague image of a woman&#39;s face. Elisabeth&#39;s unloved child? Alma&#39;s aborted fetus?<br/><br/>An endless line of critics, it seems, have celebrated &#39;Persona&#39; as a masterpiece, and among the greatest films ever made. I&#39;d hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but the film is certainly the lesser of the three Bergmans I&#39;ve hitherto seen, if only due to the noticeable absence of the good-natured humour to be found in both &#39;The Seventh Seal (1957)&#39; and &#39;Wild Strawberries (1957)&#39;. If, indeed, I were to describe &#39;Persona&#39; as a masterpiece, it would be in regards to the visuals, which, photographed by long-time Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist, are beyond description in their detail and intimacy. The film takes particular interest in the human face, and entire conversations of words and emotions are played out through the communication of the eyes, and the glimmering hint of a smile on the lips. There is one immortal moment in the film when Bergman juxtaposes the faces of each woman onto the screen, merging Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann) and Alma (Bibi Andersson) into a single entity.<br/><br/>Persona also includes one of the most vivid depictions of sex that I&#39;ve ever seen. Though the film shows us nothing, Alma&#39;s whispered description of an intimate encounter on the beach is staggering in its effectiveness; her words allow the viewer to formulate their own visuals, every emotion and nuance perfectly incorporated from the rich story we are being told. Though I may exhaust hours spouting the merits of Ingmar Bergman&#39;s film, I can&#39;t escape the fact that watching &#39;Persona&#39; felt very much like a chore. The film boasts a relatively short running time, but it never seems to attain any comfortable sense of rhythm, and, by the film&#39;s end, I was left wondering just what the film was trying to get at. Bergman includes various allusions to Bertolt Brecht&#39;s &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; effect  highlighting the inherent artificiality of the cinematic medium  with the film at one point appearing to burn; but, unlike in Fellini&#39;s &#39;8½ (1963),&#39; these self-referential flourishes seem to serve little foreseeable purpose. Am I looking too far into this film for meaning? Or am I not looking far enough? Even just hours afterwards, another layer of meaning has unfurled itself. Maybe it&#39;ll get better.",

                        "plaidHtml": "After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children&#39;s movies I have seen in a decade: <strong>8.5/10.0</strong><br/><br/>Now, I&#39;m a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.<br/><br/>The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy&#39;s growing relationship with his friend. <br/><br/>This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don&#39;t know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children&#39;s movies, it is still very original and clever.<br/><br/>One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird&#39;s influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie&#39;s antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids&#39; movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about &quot;duck and cover&quot; and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.<br/><br/>On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.",

From his design to his style to pretty much everything there is about him, he absolutely steals the show! From the moment he appears during the movie, he is just seems so much like the the star of the movie. Robin Williams as the Genie is one of the best performances in any animated movie. Aladdin is such an awesome movie that I can&#39;t give it anything other than 10 out of 10",

It features redemption, nay, salvation. The camera captures the prairie beautifully, the bluest of blue skies and the whitest and puffiest of white clouds, the most colorful of colorful ground, the roundest of rolling hills, and the largest of buffalo herds.
